scholar in Wilmington, North Carolina. Welcome 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:90%
to both of you. I know you both do research, 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:90%
teaching and also see patients, so we're delighted 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:90%
to have you on our panel today.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Just to background, some of the information that 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be touching on is this area of 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:90%
cognitive impairment, which we see very often in 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:90%
older adults in our practice. We as clinicians need 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
to be aware of the different types of factors, 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:90%
medications, medical conditions that can affect 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:90%
driving, and makes sure we consider driving as an 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:90%
important instrumental activity of daily living in 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:90%
our practice. I think it's also important, not just 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:90%
the safety issues, because we know that there is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000 align:middle line:90%
some risk in driving with older adults, especially 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:90%
those that have medical impairments. But we also 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:90%
know older adults are risk for driving cessation. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:90%
The average older adult male may be without 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:90%
driving a car for six years, a female for 10 years. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:90%
That's a long time. And what are those risk 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:90%
factors? Pretty much the same as they are for 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:90%
motor vehicle crashes. We know that there's age 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:90%
associated illnesses, visual impairment, cognitive 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:90%
decline, diminished motor strength that can occur 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:90%
as we age.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Tammy, would you like to talk to us a little bit 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:90%
about some of the crash statistics and some of 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:90%
our concerns about older adult drivers?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, thank you David. We do know that older 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:90%
adults have an increased crash risk and fatality 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:90%
rate per miles driven. And this is the highest in 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:90%
this aging demographic compared to any other 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:90%
demographics. These graphs right here actually 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:90%
show us the significant change and the increased 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:90%
driver fatalities.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:90%
We also know that these numbers are expected to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:90%
only increase. Dr. Hill, could you tell us a little 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:90%
bit about the prevalence of cognitive impairment?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Why this is such an important issue for clinicians?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Certainly. Dementia prevalence rises with age. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Only 2.4% of individuals 65 to 74 years of age 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:90%
have cognitive impairment, whereas this 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:90%
percentage ranges between 34 and 50% in those 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000 align:middle line:90%
over age 85. However, primary care physicians 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000 align:middle line:90%
are missing as many as 76% of dementia cases, 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:90%
and 65% of dementia diagnoses are not 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:90%
documented in outpatient medical records. Part 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:90%
of this trend is explained by the quarter of older 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:90%
adults without overt signs of cognitive 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000 align:middle line:90%
impairment, but who failed testing when done. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:90%
The other issue is the lack of systematic screening.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:90%
We'd like to present a case that we've had in 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:90%
clinic, of an 83-year-old female whose major 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:90%
complaint is a short-term memory loss. She's 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:90%
accompanied by her daughter in clinic, and the 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:90%
daughter does raise concerns about driving. No 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:90%
specifics but just in general, given mother's 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
slowed reaction time. Also as noted, some 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:90%
repetition, some short-term memory loss, and 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:90%
some of the medications and medical conditions. 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:90%
A review of the record does show a past medical 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:90%
history of hypertension, diabetes, and general 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:90%
anxiety disorder. Her current medications are 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:90%
atenolol, metformin, alprazolam, and sertraline. 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:90%
So we'd like to use this case as an example as we 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:90%
go through our curriculum, and address what is 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:90%
MCI, and how can it potentially impact driving.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:90%
So when it comes to making the diagnosis of MCI, 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:90%
there are several areas that the clinician needs to 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%
be aware of. First of all is a concern regarding a 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:90%
change in cognition. This could either be from the 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:90%
collateral source, the informant, or the patient. 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:90%
And clinicians need to be aware that the brain can 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:90%
go down in a variety of different ways. It doesn't 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000 align:middle line:90%
just have to be short-term memory. We can be 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:90%
talking language, visual spatial skill, attention, 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle line:90%
what we call executive function, which again can 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:90%
be changes in personality or behavior, 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:90%
sequencing, organizing, etc. There also needs to 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:90%
be documented impairment in one or more 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:90%
cognitive domains.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Historically in research situations, this was done 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:90%
by psychometric tests in neuro psychologists, but 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:90%
clinicians can certainly assess different cognitive 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:90%
domains, and we have tools like the MoCA, mini 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:90%
mental status examination, and brief mental 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:90%
status screens that we can apply in the clinical 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:90%
setting, that will help us determine if the history 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:90%
goes along with the cognitive testing.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:90%
The third aspect of a diagnosis of mild cognitive 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:90%
impairment is the relative preservation or 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:90%
independence in functional abilities. Now how is 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:90%
the clinician to assess those abilities? One 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:90%
common tool is the functional assessment 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:90%
questionnaire that asks 10 questions over a 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000 align:middle line:90%
variety of different activities of daily living. 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:90%
The AD-8, also known as the Alzheimer's disease 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:90%
questionnaire eight, has questions, some related to

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:90%
cognitive impairment, but many related to functional

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:90%
decline. And finally some of the classic tools in 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:90%
the geriatric literature, the Katz and Lawton tools 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:90%
for basic activities of daily living and instrumental

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:90%
activities of daily living that are out there.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:90%
The final aspect of a diagnosis of mild cognitive 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:90%
impairment, is that the individual is not 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000 align:middle line:90%
demented. So again, we go back to this issue 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:90%
where we're not seeing functional impairment, 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:90%
and there's also no impairment in social or 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:90%
occupational functioning. The diagnosis of MCI 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:90%
that we just mentioned is compatible with the 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:90%
DSM-V criteria, mild neurocognitive disorder. 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:90%
But I think there are some key points that need 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:90%
to be discussed for clinicians if they're going to 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:90%
tackle this diagnosis in their office.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:90%
We get into semantics, but theoretically with MCI, 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:90%
you shouldn't have functional impairment. So if 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:90%
somebody had some cognitive decline that is 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:90%
obviously infecting their driving, one could 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000 align:middle line:90%
actually classify that individual as having a 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:90%
dementing illness, which makes sense. It's not 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:90%
always obvious, and that's part of what our 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:90%
discussion and curriculum is today. I think it's also 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:90%
fair to say, as you know, especially in patients that 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:90%
have short-term memory impairment, they may 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:90%
not be very accurate in their histories. So we 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:90%
really urge clinicians to allow a person who knows 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:90%
the patient to come in and have that dialogue.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Many clinicians feel comfortable diagnosing 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's disease in an MCI phase. However, 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:90%
progression is variable, and we know that similar 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:90%
to dementia, MCI is a syndrome, and there's a lot 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:90%
of different causes. And clinicians need to rule out 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:90%
those reversible causes for cognitive decline.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000 align:middle line:90%
I think it's also important for many of us that 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:90%
follow our patients that we've labeled with MCI, 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:90%
many do stay stable over time.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Finally, I think it's also important to make two 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:90%
additional points. One is that it's not all about 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:90%
short-term memory. We mentioned that before. 

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:90%
There are other cognitive domains, language 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:90%
decline, executive dysfunction, attention, visual 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:90%
spatial impairment, that we need to ask about. 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's also fair to say that no 

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:90%
pharmacological interventions have been shown 

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000 align:middle line:90%
useful in this state.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle line:90%
So in going on with our case, as we interviewed 

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:90%
both the patient and the daughter, they both 

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:90%
endorsed short-term memory loss. The individual 

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:90%
could repeat questions, misplace items. This was 

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:90%
further corroborated on a MoCA score, which 

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:90%
showed impaired recall. Currently there was no 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:90%
obvious impairment in social, occupational or IDL 

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:90%
function. So based on both the history and exam, 

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000 align:middle line:90%
felt like this was a diagnosis of mild cognitive 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:90%
impairment. So in this situation, we do believe 

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:90%
that working individuals up for reversible causes 

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:90%
of dementia is indicated.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:90%
One of our mnemonics that we typically use in 

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:90%
geriatrics is DEMENTIA where D is for drugs. 

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:90%
So we need to consider medications that can mimic 

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. 

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Emotional disorders such as anxiety or depression 

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:90%
which we know can affect older adults’ cognition. 

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Metabolic disorders such as obstructive sleep 

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:90%
apnea that can cause hypoxia. Sensory 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:90%
deprivation, nutritional deficiencies such as B12. 

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Brain injuries, infections and vascular issues such 

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle line:90%
as stroke or seizure disorders, can be in the 

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:90%
differential diagnosis and need to be considered.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Now in our patient, we did some screens that 

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:90%
helped supplement and look for some of these 

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:90%
causes. One that we recommend to clinicians is 

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:90%
adopting the Epworth sleepiness scale, which 

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:90%
basically is a tried and true scale for 

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:90%
hypersomnolence. Score of 10 or greater is an 

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:90%
abnormal score. Doesn't necessarily mean 

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:90%
somebody has a primary sleep disorder, may be 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:90%
either sedated from their benzos or their 

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:90%
anticholinergic drugs. But if you see a level and 

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle line:90%
this individual has a score of 12, that's a concern.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:90%
The patient health questionnaire, which basically 

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:90%
follows the outline for DSM five criteria for major 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:90%
depression disorder, is a nice screen that 

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:90%
clinicians can adopt. And in this individual, she 

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000 align:middle line:90%
had a score of 12 which showed some mild 

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:90%
depressive symptomatology. Thankfully there was 

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:90%
no history of hypoglycemia, but the medication 

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000 align:middle line:90%
review did identify a concerning drug, alprazolam.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Now before we can go on with a further 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:90%
evaluation in the clinical setting, what do we 

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:90%
know about MCI in the driving literature? Well, 

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:90%
the studies are few, but they tend to line up with 

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:90%
two general findings. One is that individuals with 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000 align:middle line:90%
mild cognitive impairment on average appear to 

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000 align:middle line:90%
have more errors when performing driving 

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:90%
simulation tasks, or on the road tests. However, 

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:90%
on the positive side, studies have shown the 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:90%
potential for training and education can 

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:90%
potentially improve driving safety behaviors. 

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Improvement in simulation performance, and 

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:90%
improvement in on the road testing was noted in 

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
a couple of interventions. Again, small studies, 

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:90%
nothing's been proven, but I think it shows some 

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:90%
optimism that this may be a group that could 

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:90%
benefit by education.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Tammy, would you like to talk to a little bit about 

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:90%
additional information we could obtain in the 

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:90%
clinic that might put older adults at risk for 

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000 align:middle line:90%
driving impairment?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely. As a clinician, sometimes we have to 

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:90%
be a detective, if you will, and be alert to some 

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:90%
red flags on our medical exam and history taking. 

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:90%
So when we're taking the history of the patient, 

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:90%
from the patient as well as any family members 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:90%
that may be included, we really need to be alert 

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:90%
to any medical conditions, any sensory conditions 

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:90%
or cognitive motor changes, as well as the 

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:90%
medications that you've identified. As well as 

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000 align:middle line:90%
really looking at that functional decline that our 

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
older patients sometimes do have.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:90%
And so we're looking for any type of decreased 

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:90%
short-term memory, which you discussed, and 

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:90%
obtained that information through the MoCA 

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:90%
screening. Decreased or impaired way finding. 

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:90%
You see this especially with road construction. 

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Somebody having more difficulty finding their 

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000 align:middle line:90%
way around road constructions and detours. 

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Somebody who's being reportedly easily 

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:90%
distracted. And not really able to learn new 

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:90%
information as quickly as they used to.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Near misses and unexplained crashes. An older 

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:90%
adult's car may have scratches or unexplained 

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:90%
dents that a family member may recognize. Poor 

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:90%
judgment making left turns, sensory depth 

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:90%
perceptions can actually cause some of this 

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:90%
problem. Confusing the gas and brake pedal, of 

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:90%
course, is a big thing that needs to be looked at. 

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Getting lost while driving.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Difficultly merging and changing lanes is also 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:90%
something that needs to be really considered 

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:90%
because you have the physical mobility that you 

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:90%
need to be able to turn your neck to be able to 

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:90%
see, as well as, again, that decision making 

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:90%
equipped judgment, and literature's also showing 

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:90%
us that older adults who have falls are also at an 

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:90%
increased risk of motor vehicle crashes.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you might see a patient with an older 

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:90%
adult child who actually makes comments such as, 

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:90%
"I'm afraid to ride with my mom, my dad," or, 

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:90%
"I don't feel comfortable letting my children actually 

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:90%
in the car riding with my mom or my dad." These 

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:90%
are really big comments and concerns and you 

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:90%
really, as a provider, cannot discount these 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:90%
comments because it's telling you that there is a 

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:90%
big concern here for their safety as well as the 

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:90%
safety of other drivers on the road.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000 align:middle line:90%
So, the Clinician's Guide, the fourth edition, has 

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:90%
recently come out. This describes the clinical 

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:90%
team that we create around our older adult 

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:90%
drivers, as well as their families and when the 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:90%
appropriate time is for driving retirement. And 

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:90%
then it also helps us identify who is at risk for 

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:90%
unsafe driving. Again, we don't want people 

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:90%
having to give up driver's license that aren't ready 

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:90%
to do so because, again, if that is the case, they're 

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:90%
losing some of their independence too early and 

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:90%
we don't want that.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Some of the screening tools that you've 

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:90%
identified, the functional assessments. 

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Oftentimes, an older patient may become quite 

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:90%
defensive if they hear the term "driving 

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:90%
cessation," "driving retirement."

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Looking at clinical interventions that can be done 

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000 align:middle line:90%
to help someone maintain driving independence 

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:90%
as long possible.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Transitioning into driving retirement, again, has to 

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:90%
be an ongoing conversation. There are some legal 

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:90%
and ethical issues that we have to consider when 

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:90%
it comes to this. State reporting laws vary in every 

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:90%
state. And in the Clinician's Guide, there are 

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:90%
reference tables that discuss different medical 

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:90%
conditions and functional deficits, as well as 

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:90%
medications that providers really need to be 

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:90%
aware of that can affect driving abilities.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:90%
So, how about some of the team members and 

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:90%
who can we turn to help us with some 

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:90%
of these challenges?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question because a lot of us don't 

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:90%
feel comfortable making this decision alone, and 

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:90%
we really shouldn't because we do have a team of 

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:90%
professionals that we can communicate with and 

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:90%
collaborate with. Occupational therapists are one 

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:90%
professional colleague that we can turn to, as 

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:90%
many of them are professionals in identifying 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:90%
when a person really should stop driving.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:90%
We do have driving rehabilitation specialists as 

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:90%
well as neuropsychologist who can perform some 

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:90%
of the psychometric testing that you referenced 

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:90%
into the case. Social workers can also help us 

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000 align:middle line:90%
identify alternative forms of transportation for 

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:90%
people. Medical assistants can help us in 

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:90%
identifying some of those functional declines. 

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Traffic safety professionals actually is a very global 

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:90%
term to include our law enforcements as well as 

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:90%
DMV professionals. The Clinician's Guide office-

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:90%
based screening tests could be inconclusive, and 

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:90%
further testing and assessments may be needed. 

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:90%
For example, neurology or neuropsychological 

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle line:90%
testing or social work may need to be brought in.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:90%
So Linda, clinicians have a lot of options for 

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000 align:middle line:90%
different tests that they can do in the office 

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000 align:middle line:90%
setting and we'd like to hear a little bit more 

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:90%
about your perspectives on when and how often 

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000 align:middle line:90%
these tests should be done and what are the 

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:90%
choices that we have.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I suggest starting screening at 70. And then, I do it 

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:90%
about every two to three years, although I do it 

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle line:90%
earlier and more frequently if I see signs of MCI or 

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:90%
a decline in baseline driving skills, either reported 

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:90%
by my patient or the caregivers.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I do take a thorough medical history to identify 

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:90%
any conditions characterized by lapses of 

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, which may require reporting to 

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:90%
the DMV. So, this includes dementia, seizures, 

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:90%
loss of consciousness, brain tumors, and 

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000 align:middle line:90%
abnormal metabolic states associated with a loss 

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness. I do obtain a thorough 

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:90%
medication history to rule out any medications 

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle line:90%
that may be interfering with driving.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:90%
So, what are some of these office screening tools?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:90%
The Clinician's Guide recommends formally 

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:90%
screening for vision, frailty, and cognitive decline, 

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000 align:middle line:90%
starting with vision and strength testing. The 

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:90%
details are outlined in the guide. The tests were 

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:90%
selected based on an extensive review of the 

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:90%
literature, as well as the counsel of an expert 

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:90%
panel. Some of these assessments can be 

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:90%
conducted by the medical assistant or nurse in 

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:90%
your office, allowing me as the clinician to 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:90%
interpret and manage the results.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:90%
While there are many cognitive assessments 

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:90%
available, these tests were selected because they 

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:90%
are simple and quick, done with pencil and paper, 

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:90%
and can be administered by a clinician. The Maze 

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000 align:middle line:90%
test is first and is a required element of screening. 

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Failure is if it takes longer than 60 seconds, with 

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:90%
or without errors.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:90%
The cognitive tests are the MoCA or the trail 

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:90%
making B and clock drawing. Trail making and 

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:90%
clock drawing are components of the MoCA. The 

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:90%
MoCA's a 10-minute test that's measured by 

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:90%
performance on 11 components. It's available in 

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:90%
multiple languages and is scored on a scale of 1 to 

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:90%
30, with additional points being added if the 

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:90%
patient has less than 12 years of formal education.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:90%
The next cognitive assessment is the trail making 

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:90%
test. It evaluates cognitive skills, as the goal is to 

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:90%
have the patient make logical connections from 

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:90%
one item to another, according to the rules. 

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Corrective lenses should be worn as vision 

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000 align:middle line:90%
impairment could impact the test results. 

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Administering trail making A prior to trail making 

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle line:90%
B improves sensitivity and specificity and is 

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:90%
consistent with studies that have used these tools 

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
to predict driving performance.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Trail making B is shown here. Instruct the patient 

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:90%
to alternate numbers and letters. Start the timer 

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the test. If the patient makes 

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:90%
a mistake, have them go back to the last correct 

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:90%
number or letter and continue, but don't stop the 

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:90%
clock. Stop the timer when finished or at five 

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:90%
minutes. Refusal or quitting is scored as a failure. 

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:90%
The interpretation of trail making's very simple; 

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:90%
a time of greater than 180 seconds is a failure. 

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:90%
However, screening tests for dementia can result 

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:90%
in false positives due to depression, visual 

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:90%
impairment, or metabolic disorders, such as 

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:90%
hypoglycemia. Medications can also interfere 

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:90%
with cognitive function on a temporary basis. 

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:90%
While normal controls complete trail making in 

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:90%
less than 81 seconds, individuals with MCI 

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:90%
average 130 seconds to completion.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:90%
If you do not do the MoCA, the final test is the 

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000 align:middle line:90%
clock drawing test. Tell the patient to draw a clock 

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:90%
on a piece of paper as a child would. Ask them to 

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:90%
draw the face of the clock, put in all the numbers, 

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:90%
and set the time to 10 minutes after 11:00. The 

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:90%
interpretation is based on the presence of the 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:90%
numbers 1 through 12 in order inside the circle, 

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:90%
evenly spaced from each other and the edge, only 

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:90%
two clock hands, and one hand pointing to two 

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:90%
with no intrusive marks. This can be scored on a 

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:90%
seven-point scale or pass/fail. This test has the 

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:90%
advantage of only requiring numeracy and not 

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:90%
literacy, and is culturally appropriate across 

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000 align:middle line:90%
groups. Failure of the test or refusal is highly 

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:90%
predictive of dementia. MCI cannot be diagnosed 

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:90%
with this pass/fail format, but scoring each 

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:90%
element individually may have some utility in 

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:90%
distinguishing MCI from dementia.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Linda, thank you for all that information on 

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:90%
screening. In going back to our case in talking with 

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:90%
both the patient and the daughter, our patient 

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:90%
had no history of prior driving performance 

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:90%
issues. The alprazolam, since it has been 

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000 align:middle line:90%
associated with increased crash risk in older 

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:90%
adults, was slowly tapered off. Sertraline was 

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000 align:middle line:90%
increased for depression and for anxiety 

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:90%
symptoms. Thankfully, visual acuity corrected and 

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000 align:middle line:90%
was 20/40, which is generally legal in most states. 

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Test results reviewed with the patient’s daughter 

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:90%
and the patient was counseled that she continued 

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:90%
to drive, but given her diagnosis of MCI and also 

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000 align:middle line:90%
her trajectory, which was concerning, we wanted 

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:90%
her back to be reassessed in the office in six months.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:90%
So, Dr. Hill, talk to us a little bit about some of the

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:90%
next steps when it comes to following our 

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:90%
patients that have been diagnosed with MCI.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:90%
The screening test for medically-related driving 

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:90%
impairments include four domains: vision, frailty, 

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:90%
lapses of consciousness, and cognition. For those 

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:90%
failing vision or frailty testing without a reversible 

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:90%
cause, driving cessation should be discussed and 

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:90%
reporting to the DMV considered. Lapses of 

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:90%
consciousness may have treatable causes, such as 

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:90%
hypoglycemia, and are also reportable in some 

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:90%
states. In the work-up of cognitive decline, only 

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:90%
those with MCI and mild dementia should be 

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:90%
evaluated further for driving abilities, since 

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:90%
moderate and severe dementia diagnoses are not 

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:90%
compatible with safe driving and dementia's 

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000 align:middle line:90%
reportable in some states.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:90%
When MCI is diagnosed, look for reversible 

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:90%
causes, as we've discussed, and assess for 

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:90%
amnestic components. Those with single-domain 

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:90%
MCI who are non-amnestic can continue driving 

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:90%
but need to be followed yearly. If an amnestic 

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:90%
component is present, obtain an on-the-road 

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:90%
assessment or simulator testing. Those failing 

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:90%
should be advised to retire from driving. Those 

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000 align:middle line:90%
passing with amnestic MCI should be followed 

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:90%
up in six months.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:90%
So, Tammy, tell us a little bit about these health 

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:90%
professionals, that may be able to help us in 

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:90%
evaluating our patients.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Actually I'd like to take a step back for a second 

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000 align:middle line:90%
if I might, and just say that DRSs are highly trained 

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000 align:middle line:90%
to evaluate and teach, but there are so few of them. 

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:90%
They are not always available, and there may be 

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:90%
other instrumental activities of daily 

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000 align:middle line:90%
living issues going on.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:90%
So, a referral to an occupational therapist for a 

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:90%
comprehensive evaluation of IADLs can offer a lot 

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:90%
of information to determine if the person has no 

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:90%
indication of issues or is so impaired that they 

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:90%
cannot follow a two-step direction, or is not ready 

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000 align:middle line:90%
for a driving evaluation.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:90%
This comprehensive evaluation by the 

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000 align:middle line:90%
occupational therapist can also tell us if a person 

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:90%
would benefit from a comprehensive driving 

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000 align:middle line:90%
evaluation. Seeing the occupational therapist is 

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:90%
equivalent to using appropriate cutoff scores on 

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:90%
screening tools, and OTs are best able to decide 

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:90%
whether the referral to a specialist is needed.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:90%
It is sort of like using triage just as 

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:90%
in any medical setting.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:90%
So, Linda, what are some other conditions that 

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:90%
might impact driving that clinicians 

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:90%
should be aware of?

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:90%
It's important to address individuals with MCI and 

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:90%
assess them holistically for other driving impairing 

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:90%
medical conditions, such as those listed here, and 

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:90%
treat as appropriate. For example, obstructive 

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:90%
sleep apnea warrants sleep studies and CPAP if 

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:90%
appropriate. Hypoglycemia from diabetes can be 

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:90%
managed with improved control.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, as we age, we also tend to 

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000 align:middle line:90%
accumulate prescribed and OTC daily 

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:90%
medications. There are numerous medications 

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:90%
that can reduce the ability to drive safely when 

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:90%
taken alone, and often the effects are multiplied 

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:90%
as two or more drugs interact. There are many 

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms by which medication acts to impair 

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:90%
the driving task, although delayed reaction time 

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:90%
and drowsy driving may be more common ones, 

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:90%
other potential drug side effects include dizziness, 

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:90%
confusion, and blurred vision.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Medications can potentially enhance driving 

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:90%
ability, such as non-sedating pain medications or 

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Parkinson medications, for example, where the 

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:90%
symptoms are improved but they don't have side effects.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately, de-prescribing, where possible, is the 

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:90%
best practice. Avoiding high-risk drug classes, 

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:90%
using the lowest possible doses, will also reduce 

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:90%
the effects of prescription medication on driving.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:90%
An estimated 35% of dementia is preventable 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000 align:middle line:90%
with the adoption of the protective behaviors 

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:90%
listed here. We should educate our patients on 

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000 align:middle line:90%
the risks of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and 

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:90%
obesity. Encouraging exercise and a healthy diet is 

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:90%
a great idea, and control of hearing loss and 

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:90%
hypertension is also beneficial in preventing 

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:90%
cognitive decline.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:90%
So this is exciting since we have the potential to 

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:90%
actually prolong safe driving life expectancy with 

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:90%
healthy lifestyle behaviors. Again, nothing proven, 

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:90%
but there's a lot of potential there and certainly 

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:90%
we recommend that in the primary care setting.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Tammy, can you talk to us a little bit about some 

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:90%
of the courses and other things that may be 

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:90%
available out there to help preserve driving skills?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sometimes patients may ask us what they 

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:90%
can do to preserve driving capabilities. And these 

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:90%
courses I'm going to mention are available, 

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:90%
although they have not been proven to improve 

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:90%
driving safety.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000 align:middle line:90%
There is recent evidence, albeit small, that should 

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000 align:middle line:90%
not discourage participation and certainly 

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:90%
encourage further study. And these you would be 

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000 align:middle line:90%
able to find on the AARP websites, the AAA online 

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000 align:middle line:90%
defensive driving courses, traffic school-based 

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:90%
driving courses, and DMV driving courses.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000 align:middle line:90%
So to follow up on our case, one year later the 

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:90%
patient came back and unfortunately, as was the 

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000 align:middle line:90%
initial concern, the patient had progressed. The 

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:90%
daughter noted worsening cognitive decline in 

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:90%
memory and in judgment. There was more 

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000 align:middle line:90%
functional decline in the way of cooking, cleaning, 

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000 align:middle line:90%
and keeping the house tidy. And now the patient 

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:90%
met official criteria for dementia and Alzheimer's 

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:90%
disease. In addition, when reviewing some of the 

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000 align:middle line:90%
driving behaviors, there was a minor crash that 

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000 align:middle line:90%
occurred when backing into a car in a parking lot, 

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:90%
and indeed the cognitive scores had declined. 

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Trail Making Test B was now over 200 seconds, 

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:90%
and clock drawing was much more impaired with 

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:90%
a score of two, or a fail.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000 align:middle line:90%
So in this situation, we recommended driving 

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:90%
retirement. We did not believe that on-road 

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000 align:middle line:90%
assessment was indicated based on the 

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:90%
information that we had at hand. The patient was 

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000 align:middle line:90%
resistant to retiring from driving, so we did make 

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:90%
a referral to case manager or social services to 

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:90%
assist with this.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000 align:middle line:90%
So Tammy, what can you suggest to clinicians 

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:90%
regarding how can we help our older adults stay 

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:90%
socially connected?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000 align:middle line:90%
One thing that we need to do is we need to 

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000 align:middle line:90%
discuss driving retirement plans long before they 

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000 align:middle line:90%
are needed. So there are five As that we need to 

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:90%
look at when we're talking to our patients and our 

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:90%
families. These are also in the Clinician’s Guide.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Availability of alternate transportation when the 

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000 align:middle line:90%
person needs it the most.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Accessibility of alternate transportations.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Acceptability of alternate forms of transportation 

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000 align:middle line:90%
needs to be considered, such as the cleanliness, 

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:90%
or the standards, or whether or not the 

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:90%
neighborhood is safe for the person to get to 

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:90%
these alternate forms of transportation.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Affordability of forms of transportation must be 

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:90%
considered as many older adults are living 

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000 align:middle line:90%
on a fixed income.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Adaptability is the fifth A in the Clinician’s Guide. 

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:90%
And this can be talking about their current vehicle 

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:90%
and whether or not their vehicle can be adapted 

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000 align:middle line:90%
to prolong their safe driving, and again, prolong 

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:90%
driving life expectancy if appropriate for the person.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Conversations with the patients and family, again, 

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000 align:middle line:90%
have to be ongoing, we need to have a very 

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:90%
holistic approach where we include all of the 

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:90%
clinical team members that we've recently 

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000 align:middle line:90%
discussed in this conversation. We want to use 

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000 align:middle line:90%
objective testing that we have talked about to 

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:90%
explain to the person and their family about the 

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:90%
safety concerns. When we use the objective 

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000 align:middle line:90%
measures, it eliminates or decreases the amount 

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:90%
of emotional response that people have. Some 

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000 align:middle line:90%
patients that I've had have actually responded 

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:90%
better to having a written prescription indicating 

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000 align:middle line:90%
that they really should stop driving. The 

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000 align:middle line:90%
conversation really should begin at the time of 

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:90%
diagnosis, as soon as we understand that the 

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:90%
diagnosis will be progressive.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Appropriate language such as driving retirement 

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:90%
should be used, rather than one is unable or unfit 

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000 align:middle line:90%
to drive any longer.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Tammy, I think that's a great point, because when 

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000 align:middle line:90%
you think about it, so many times people will 

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000 align:middle line:90%
show up on our doorstep and it's like, "Oh my 

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:90%
God, they need to be off the road," and it's such a 

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:90%
difficult pill to swallow for patients and families.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely. You don't want the patient to feel like 

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000 align:middle line:90%
they're being ganged up on by the team, but you 

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:90%
want to be working with the patient. Motivational 

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000 align:middle line:90%
interviewing skills help with this. And unless there 

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000 align:middle line:90%
are no other choices for safety concerns, do not 

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000 align:middle line:90%
abruptly take the keys away from somebody.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:90%
So we also can get into this issue of reporting. Are 

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:90%
there situations where we will consider reporting 

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000 align:middle line:90%
and how do we do that, Linda?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a really complex issue. The laws vary from 

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000 align:middle line:90%
state to state. The Clinician’s Guide outlines 

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000 align:middle line:90%
details about this process. MCI is generally not 

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:90%
reportable and only dementia.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000 align:middle line:90%
So where else can one find assistance? In general, 

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000 align:middle line:90%
if a clinician wants more information about MCI 

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:90%
and diagnosis, the Alzheimer's Association has an 

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:90%
amazing website, the AD Education Referral 

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000 align:middle line:90%
center also [is] good. If clinicians want more 

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:90%
information on screening and assessment, they 

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:90%
can go to the Clinician's Guide and there are other 

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000 align:middle line:90%
countries that keep up-to-date manuals on 

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000 align:middle line:90%
medical conditions. A couple that come to mind 

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000 align:middle line:90%
are the CMA, Canadian Medical Association. And 

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to assessment, as we said, we 

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000 align:middle line:90%
prefer to have someone who's, if there's going to 

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000 align:middle line:90%
be a performance-based road test, that's familiar 

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000 align:middle line:90%
with memory problems, cognitive domains in 

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000 align:middle line:90%
driving. One can do some research to look for 

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:90%
some of these individuals if they're in your area 

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:90%
through the American Occupational Therapy 

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Association website.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Finally, if you're having difficulty in finding those 

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000 align:middle line:90%
mobility options or those driving destinations, 

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:90%
referral to a case manager, eldercare locator, 

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000 align:middle line:90%
perhaps a referral to the Association on Aging 

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:90%
that's local, may have some tips on where other 

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000 align:middle line:90%
transportation options are available to our clients.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:90%
So in conclusion, MCI and dementia are increasing 

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000 align:middle line:90%
in prevalence with our aging population. We 

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:90%
know that certain levels of cognitive decline will 

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:90%
adversely affect driving skills and safety, and 

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000 align:middle line:90%
certainly if one continues to progress like a 

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000 align:middle line:90%
neurodegenerative disease, eventually 

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000 align:middle line:90%
driving will have to stop.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Older drivers in your clinic should be assessed 

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:90%
routinely for cognitive function. If there are 

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:90%
concerns and it's appropriate, assess with some of 

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:90%
the driving red flags and certainly rule out 

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000 align:middle line:90%
reversible causes are in order. The diagnosis of 

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000 align:middle line:90%
MCI should prompt further assessment if those 

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000 align:middle line:90%
red flags or declines or failed screens are found.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Again, we'd like to summarize. Consider 

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000 align:middle line:90%
recommending adopting healthy lifestyle 

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000 align:middle line:90%
behaviors, because you may not only help the
