NEXT LINE:     --POPEN--The anatomy is such that, again, we are looking at nerve plexi both afferent and efferent nerves arising and coming down from the aorta toward the parenchyma of the kidney, and the idea is that hopefully these nerves sit near or on top of the renal arteries where we can deliver either energy, perhaps medications, and even ultrasound energy has been looked at in terms of modulating the effect of both the afferent and efferent in those areas.--PCLOSE--

NEXT LINE:     --POPEN--<strong>Dr Weber: </strong> That is fascinating. This is all predicated around the fact that the renal nerves are close to the renal artery. So, if we can put a catheter in the renal artery and put out energy or drugs, we should be able to destroy much or most of the renal nerves. So, just very quickly, for people who are not basic physiologist, how does that work?--PCLOSE--

NEXT LINE:     --POPEN--<strong>Dr Lee:</strong> A lot of the work has been done looking at things like norepinephrine levels, also activity that can be measured for the sympathetic nervous system and again the concept here is that we can deliver a device that will modulate and mitigate some of the over work of these renal nerves. And, by modulating that signal hopefully then we can get the desired response which is again a reduction in sympathetic tone and hopefully as a consequence of that a reduction in people's BP. --PCLOSE--

NEXT LINE:     --POPEN--<strong>Dr Weber:</strong> Even though basic scientists have known for some time, a lot of people did not realize that the afferent nerves, which go from the kidney back up to the brain, have a big regulatory part of how the brain adjusts sympathetic activity for the whole body. --PCLOSE--

NEXT LINE:     --POPEN--So, if the kidney wants sympathetic activity increased, it sends that message, if it wants it decreased it sends another message. So, when we sever those nerves, assuming that there is too much sympathetic activity, then we ought to see a nice fall in pressure.--PCLOSE--
