- Constructor should:
    - Take in parameters for required fields 
        - Example: TOC parameters 
            - TOC type 
    - Establish main _elements array 
        - This property is a private representation of the 
          classes' child elements 
        - New child elements will be pushed onto this array 
            - Need different implementations for inserting 
              content onto this array. 
- Getters and Setters: (Computed properties)
    - To avoid having to drill down just to manually set data 
      classes should implement getters and setters to encapsulate 
      this logic. 
        - This reduces need of developer to have to know the 
          object structure in order to implement new solutions. 
- insert...() 
    - Child classes should implement various insert() methods to insert 
    child JS objects into its own _elements array
- toObjectLiteral(): 
    - Child classes inherit this method from generic XMLElement(). 
    - This is the main API for producing object literals that 
      are formatted for xml conversion. 
    - Basically after building out the object in JS you 
      call this method when ready to convert to XML.
