- Constructor should:
    - Take in parameters for required fields 
        - Example: TOC parameters 
            - TOC type 
    - Establish main _elements array 
        - This property is a private representation of the 
          classes' child elements. 
        - New child elements will be pushed onto this array 
            - Need different implementations for inserting 
              content onto this array. 
- Getters and Setters: (Computed properties)
    - To avoid having to drill down just to manually set data 
      classes should implement getters and setters to encapsulate 
      this logic. 
        - This reduces need of developer to have to know the 
          object structure in order to implement new solutions. 
- insert...() 
    - Child classes should implement various insert() methods to insert 
    child JS objects into its own _elements array
- toObjectLiteral(): 
    - Child classes inherit this method from generic XMLElement(). 
    - This is the main API for producing object literals that 
      are formatted for xml conversion. 
    - Basically after building out the object in JS you 
      call this method when ready to convert to XML. 


------------------------------ 
GETTERS AND SETTERS
------------------------------ 
- Only use getters and setters for properties that have   the same consistent HTML/XML markup
  - For inserting dynamic content markup create an 
    insertProperty() method. 
  - Examples:
    - TOC elements, tables, etc. are always different     and therefore require a method 
    - Title, Byline, etc. always have the same markup 
      so they will use getters/setters. 

SETTER API:
  - classInstance.someProperty(<newValue>)
  - <newValue>: 
    - Should be a string of XML/HTML 
    - When passed the setter will convert it to a JS 
      object and mutate the elements array of its intended parent element. 

GETTER API: 
  - classInstance.someProperty 
  - This will return a string or null
    - The string will be plain text or HTML/XML 
      - Some properties will have 'Text' version of property to get plain text. 
    - Null gets returned when the property hasn't been 
      set yet.
