<h3> Stigma and Quality of Life in Patients With Frequent Migraine</h3>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 2&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> CaMEO Study: Background<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Nearly 20,000 respondents invited to complete Family Burden Module

<h3> Conclusions</h3>
<p>        </p>




-- COMPONENT 3 SLIDES ---------------------
        <p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 1&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Considerations in Preventive Therapy for Migraine</h3>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 2&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Patterns of Preventive Therapy Use: IBMS-II<sup type="ref">[5]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	After starting on oral generic preventive medications for migraine
<ul><li>	After 6 months, only 25% remain on treatment</li>
<li>	After a year, only 15% remain on treatment</li></ul></li>
<li>	If ask people why they discontinue, they give 2 major reasons independent of what class of medication they are on
<ul><li>	The medicine does not work well enough</li>
<li>	The medicine causes too many side effects</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 3&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Weighing Treatment Efficacy and Tolerability</h3>
<ul><li>	When thinking about whether to continue a patient on preventive treatment, look at 2 &#215; 2 table of efficacy vs side effects
<ul><li>	In cell A, the treatment is working, does not produce side effects</li>
<li>	Very likely the treatment that should be continued</li></ul></li>
<li>	In cell D, the treatment is not effective and produces side effects
<ul><li>	Very little chance patients will continue treatment and clinicians also unlikely to continue</li></ul></li>
<li>	Cell C is the most common situation with oral generic preventive medications for migraine
<ul><li>	Medication is at least somewhat effective but also producing side effects</li>
<li>	Patients and clinicians have a difficult choice to make</li></ul></li>
<li>	Emerging monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for migraine are particularly attractive
<ul><li>	They provide efficacy with little in the way of penalty in terms of adverse events</li>
<li>	Much greater chance of keeping people in cell A</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 4&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Measuring Migraine Burden in All Phases<sup type="ref">[6,7]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Phases of migraine
<ul><li>	In the preheadache (premonitory/prodrome) phase, people may have symptoms or auras</li>
<li>	In the postheadache (postdrome) phase, people may have changes in mood or behavior, fatigue, and scalp sensitivity</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 5&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Measuring Burden of Migraine Before, During, and After Migraine: MPFID<sup type="ref">[8,9]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	New study data on measuring the burden of migraine during the headache phase, and on the day before and the day after headache</li>
<li>	Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID) used to measure disability on headache days and nonheadache days
<ul><li>	Daily diary measure, asks 13 questions about ability to function</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 6&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Burden on Everyday Activities and Physical Impairment by Migraine Phase<sup type="ref">[9]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	MPFID shows burden on headache days is much greater than on days where no headache is present</li>
<li>	Substantial burden on prodromal and postdromal days
<ul><li>	Previously unappreciated in migraine studies</li></ul></li>
<li>	In future studies, measure the burden of migraine and treatment benefits on headache days, prodromal days, and postdromal days
<ul><li>	Get a fuller picture both of the burden of disease and the benefits of treatment</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 7&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Identifying Natural Subgroups of Migraine<sup type="ref">[10]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Study identifying natural subgroups of migraine to address questions
<ul><li>	Why is migraine so common?</li>
<li>	Why do the clinical features of migraine vary so much from person to person?</li>
<li>	Why is treatment response so variable?
<ul><li>	Why does one person respond to a tricyclic antidepressant, another to a beta-blocker, and another to an antiepilepsy drug?</li></ul></li>
<li>	Why has it been so difficult to identify genes for migraine?
<ul><li>	Identified genes for rare forms of migraine like familial hemiplegic migraine</li></ul></li>
<li>	Most of genetic determinants of more common forms of migraine remain to be identified</li></ul></li>
<li>	Solution is to do a better job of characterizing natural subgroups of people with migraine
<ul><li>	One approach is to use comorbidity profiles
<ul><li>	Use conditions that travel along with migraine to identify natural subgroups of migraine</li></ul></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 8&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Natural Subgroups of Migraine: Overall Results<sup type="ref">[10]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Examined people with migraine and 22 comorbidities
<ul><li>	Discovered 8 natural subgroups</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 9&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Natural Subtype of Migraine: Likelihood of Progression to CM<sup type="ref">[10]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Subgroups differed widely in prognosis
<ul><li>	Group with the most comorbidities was most likely to progress to CM</li>
<li>	Group with the fewest comorbidities was least likely to progress</li>
<li>	Substantial differences among groups in prognosis</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 10&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Looking Ahead</h3>
<ul><li>	Open questions
<ul><li>	Will these subgroups predict response to treatment?</li>
<li>	Will they correlate with neuroimaging abnormalities found in migraine?</li></ul></li>
<li>	Important clinical question
<ul><li>	Instead of engaging in a trial-and-error-process for treatment, might be able to get treatment right the first time</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3> Migraine Headache: A Treatment Update</h3>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 2&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Lasmiditan for Acute Treatment of Migraine<sup type="ref">[11,12]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Two recent updates in acute treatment of migraine</li>
<li>	New 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonist lasmiditan
<ul><li>	Built on the platform of triptans, which are 5-HT<sub>1B, 1D</sub>, and to some extent, 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonists</li>
<li>	Because of the 1D receptor agonism, triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease</li></ul></li>
<li>	Lasmiditan removed the 1B and the 1D agonism and just left the 1F receptor agonism
<ul><li>	1F receptors are not located on blood vessels, so there is no cardiovascular liability associated with this medication</li></ul></li>
<li>	Results of 2 large studies reported: SAMURAI and SPARTAN
<ul><li>	Both large, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies evaluating efficacy and safety of lasmiditan for acute treatment of migraine</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 3&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Lasmiditan: Phase 3 Study Results<sup type="ref">[12]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Used by patients to treat moderate or severe attacks</li>
<li>	Primary endpoint was percentage of patients pain free at 2 hours and percentage of patients free of their most bothersome symptom at 2 hours
<ul><li>	In both studies, 28% to 38% of patients were pain free at 2 hours</li>
<li>	About two-thirds had relief of headache in 2 hours</li>
<li>	More than 40% had relief of the most bothersome symptom</li></ul></li>
<li>	Both studies showed that all 3 doses tested -- 50, 100, 200 mg -- were all highly statistically superior to placebo</li>
<li>	No serious safety signals 
<ul><li>	Dizziness the most common adverse event, reported in about 16% to 18% of patients</li></ul></li>
<li>	Lasmiditan, if approved, will provide an option for patients for whom triptans are contraindicated
<ul><li>	Option also for patients for whom triptans were not effective or were not tolerated</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<li>	CGRP receptor antagonists rimegepant and ubrogepant evaluated in large randomized placebo-controlled studies
<ul><li>	Two studies each, or 4 studies in total</li></ul></li>
<li>	Both CGRP receptor antagonists were shown to be superior to placebo
<ul><li>	Pain-free rates of about 20% for both molecules</li>
<li>	About two-thirds of patients achieved relief of headache at 2 hours</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 5&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3>Ubrogepant for Acute Treatment of Migraine: Phase 3 Study Results<sup type="ref">[15,16]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Percentage of patients able to return to normal function exceeded 40% in studies evaluating these CGRP receptor antagonists</li>
<li>	Like lasmiditan, CGRP receptor antagonists do not constrict blood vessels
<ul><li>	Should have no contraindication for patients with established cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease</li></ul></li>
<li>	No serious safety signals seen with either drugs in any of the 4 studies
<ul><li>	No serious side effects</li>
<li>	Side effect profile for both compounds look very similar and comparable to placebo</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3> CGRP-Targeting mAbs for Migraine Prevention<sup type="ref">[6,17-26]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Erenumab, a CGRP-targeting mAb, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of migraine</li>
<li>	Two drugs are under FDA review right now and a third, an intravenous formulation, is completing phase 3 trials</li>
<li>	All of these mAbs are effective for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine and chronic migraine</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 7&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Early Rapid Onset of CGRP-Targeting mAbs<sup type="ref">[27-29]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Effective in reducing the frequency of migraine</li>
<li>	Rapid onset of effect, within about a day or a week
<ul><li>	Unprecedented, for preventive treatments for migraine</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 8&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Benefit of CGRP-Targeting mAbs in Difficult-to-Treat Populations<sup type="ref">[30-35]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Effective in patients who were otherwise medically or treatment resistant</li>
<li>	Effective in patients who have failed multiple prophylactic medications</li>
<li>	Effective in patients with medication overuse headache, independent of withdrawal from acute analgesics</li>
<li>	Unique attributes that go far above and beyond just their efficacy in preventing or reducing the frequency of migraine</li>
</ul>

<h3> Emerging Approaches for Preventive Therapy of CM</h3>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 2&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> CM: Features and Challenges<sup type="ref">[6,36,37]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	CM and EM are clinically, functionally, and anatomically differentiated
<ul><li>	Evidence suggests they may be separate conditions</li></ul></li>
<li>	Patients with CM usually have more comorbid conditions and more frequent medication overuse
<ul><li>	Complicates clinical management of CM</li></ul></li>
<li>	Estimated rate of reversion from CM to EM is relatively low
<ul><li>	Studies report remission rates of about 15% to 26%</li></ul></li>
<li>	Several mAbs targeting CGRP are in development
<ul><li>	The first was recently approved for migraine prevention</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 3&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Fremanezumab for Prevention of CM: HALO-CM<sup type="ref">[22]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Study looked at reversion of patients with CM to EM with fremanezumab treatment</li>
<li>	Fremanezumab is a CGRP mAb that can be given as a monthly or quarterly injection for prevention of migraine
<ul><li>	In clinical trials, shown to significantly reduce frequency of migraine and headache without serious treatment-related adverse events</li></ul></li>
<li>	Phase 3 HALO-CM study
<ul><li>	Patients aged 18 to 70 years with history of migraine for at least 12 months and who met International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-3 criteria for CM</li>
<li>	Randomly assigned to fremanezumab given monthly or quarterly or placebo</li>
<li>	Patients kept a daily diary and completed other questionnaires at regular intervals</li></ul></li>
<li>	Primary endpoint was mean change in the monthly average number of headache days of at least moderate severity at 12 weeks vs baseline
<ul><li>	Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability measures</li></ul></li>
<li>	Study met all of its endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 4&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Reversion From CM to EM With Fremanezumab in HALO-CM<sup type="ref">[38]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Post hoc analysis of HALO-CM data looked at proportion of patients who reverted from CM to EM
<ul><li>	Met primary outcome</li></ul></li>
<li>	Fremanezumab demonstrated efficacy as a preventive treatment for CM
<ul><li>	Decrease in mean MHD over the treatment period</li></ul></li>
<li>	Demonstrated potential benefit for reversion from CM to EM</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 5&gt;&gt;</p>
<h3> Eptinezumab for Prevention of CM: PROMISE-2<sup type="ref">[21]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	PROMISE-2 study of the CGRP-targeting mAb eptinezumab as a preventive therapy for CM
<ul><li>	Randomly assigned to a single quarterly infusion of 100 mg or 300 mg dose of eptinezumab or placebo</li>
<li>	Enrolled more than 1000 patients who had approximately 16 monthly migraine days at baseline</li></ul></li>
<li>	Subjects in both eptinezumab groups had a greater reduction in monthly migraine days vs placebo</li>
<li>	Study also met secondary endpoints
<ul><li>	More than half of subjects achieved &gt;50% reduction in MMD from weeks 1 to 12 and at monthly intervals</li>
<li>	Significantly higher proportion of patients on eptinezumab achieved 100% reduction in monthly migraine days vs placebo</li></ul></li>
