<td><p>&#8226;	This meta-analysis examined primary data from pregnant women and their children from 6 international cohorts, including community-based cohorts in Denmark, Sweden, and Ontario, Canada, and clinic-based cohorts in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Inclusion criteria for analysis were pregnancy resulting in a liveborn singleton between 1997 and 2015, availability of health-related data for both mother and infant, and presence of a mood disorder (bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) in the mother.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Also included were women who received at least 2 dispensations of lithium during pregnancy any time from 1 month before conception until the delivery, or a single lithium dispensation during pregnancy and at least 1 other lithium dispensation within 6 months before or after this date. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Exclusion criteria included prescription of known teratogenic drugs to the mother during pregnancy. </p>

<p>&#8226;	A lithium-exposed group and a mood disorder reference group were compared in terms of main outcome measures of pregnancy complications, delivery outcomes, neonatal readmission to hospital within 28 days of birth, and congenital malformations, either major malformations or major cardiac malformations (atrial and atrioventricular septal defects and Ebstein's anomaly). </p>

<p>&#8226;	Each site performed analyses using a shared protocol, including logistic regression models to calculate aORs and 95% CIs, as well as random effects meta-analytical models to pool site-specific prevalence rates and ORs.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Across the 6 cohorts, there were 22,124 eligible pregnancies, including 727 lithium-exposed group pregnancies (557 [77%] from register-based cohorts and 170 [23%] from clinical cohorts). </p>

<p>&#8226;	Compared with women not exposed to lithium during pregnancy, those exposed to lithium were more likely to be older, be nulliparous, and have filled a prescription for a psychotropic drug other than lithium during pregnancy.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Lithium exposure was not associated with any of the predefined pregnancy complications or delivery outcomes, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, fetal distress, preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age.</p>

<p>&#8226;	However, lithium exposure did confer a 62% increased risk for neonatal readmission to hospital within 28 days of birth (pooled prevalence, 27.5% [95% CI, 15.8%-39.1%] vs 14.3% [95% CI, 10.4%-18.2%]; pooled aOR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.12-2.33]). </p>

<p>&#8226;	For lithium exposure during the first trimester, risk was increased for major malformations (pooled prevalence, 7.4% [95% CI, 4.0%-10.7%] vs 4.3% [95% CI, 3.7%-4.8%]; pooled aOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.07-2.72]), but there was no significant difference for major cardiac malformations (2.1% [95% CI, 0.5%-3.7%] vs 1.6% [95% CI, 1.0%-2.1%]; pooled aOR, 1.54 [95% CI, 0.64-3.70]).</p>

<p>&#8226;	However, there were only 16 cases of major cardiac malformation across all sites, and no cases of Ebstein's anomaly. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Additional sensitivity analyses, including stratification by study design, the leave-1-out approach, and adjustment for additional variables in a subcohort from Danish and Swedish data, did not significantly change the observed associations.</p>

<p>&#8226;	On the basis of their findings, the investigators concluded that in light of the effect sizes and the precision of the estimates, treatment decisions for pregnant women with mood disorders should consider the potential for increased risks of lithium during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, against its efficacy at reducing relapse.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Increased risk for neonatal readmission to hospital within 4 weeks of birth in infants with prenatal lithium exposure may have several potential underlying mechanisms. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Lithium withdrawal after birth could directly cause neonatal morbidity, as could lithium exposure via breast-feeding, which is generally not recommended. </p>

<p>&#8226;	The underlying maternal mood disorder or increased vigilance toward infants exposed to lithium and subsequent increased detection of neonatal morbidity could also play some role.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Mental illness itself has been associated with preterm birth, cesarean delivery, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, regardless of pharmacotherapy.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Risk for relapse in women with bipolar disorder is significant during pregnancy and postpartum, based on previous studies. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Decisions regarding lithium treatment should be encouraged before conception. </p>

<p>&#8226;	To facilitate balanced decision making, clinicians should counsel women with mood disorders about the malformation risks for lithium exposure during the first trimester and about the high relapse risks during pregnancy and postpartum if lithium treatment is tapered. </p>

<p>&#8226;	In light of the well-documented efficacy of lithium in reducing relapse during the perinatal period, 1 important clinical consideration suitable for some women is to restart lithium after the first trimester or immediately postpartum. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Future studies should examine relapse risk associated with reducing lithium dose during the first trimester and should aim to identify other treatment options.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Study limitations include analysis only of pregnancies resulting in live births because of limited data on stillbirths at some study sites, lack of power to study very rare events, observational design with possible residual confounding, potential for type I error and chance findings, lack of an active comparator, and no data on lithium serum concentrations precluding analyses of dose-response associations. </p>

<p>&#8226;	In addition, less severe adverse outcomes are more likely to be reported in the lithium-exposed group because of general concern regarding teratogenic effects. </p>

<p>&#8226;	An accompanying editorial highlights study limitations of lack of data regarding the potential effect of lithium dose and failure to account for obesity, alcohol, smoking, substance misuse, or other potentially important confounders associated with increased risk for malformations, pregnancy complications, and worse outcomes. </p>

    <p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Part 2: Renal Denervation</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt; Insert Slide 1&gt;&gt; </strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt;  Part 2: Renal Denervation</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Michael A. Weber, MD:</strong> One of the interesting, I might even say exciting, developments in the management of hypertension has been the development of renal denervation, ablating or severing the renal nerves which we believe might be a very good method for reducing BP. </p>
    
    <p>I am delighted that Dr David Lee from Stanford University is here to join us because David you were in right at the beginning of this sort of technology. </p>
    
    <p>Teach us a little bit about the physiology, why should cutting the renal nerves help reduce systemic BP?</p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt; Insert Slide 2&gt;&gt; </strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt;   Nerve Supply to the Kidney<sup>[2]</sup></strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>David P. Lee, MD:</strong> We are still learning more about the sympathetic nervous system and its relationship to high BP and a whole bunch of other clinical maladies. The anatomy is important. We think that the renal arteries are extremely important but they are really more a target in terms of having us deliver some sort of device or technology to potentially help manage BP. </p>
    
    <p>A lot of work more recently has been looking at renal nerve anatomy and how do we actually approach this from a device perspective? </p>
    
    <p>The anatomy is such that, again, we are looking at nerve plexi both afferent and efferent nerves arising and coming down from the aorta toward the parenchyma of the kidney, and the idea is that hopefully these nerves sit near or on top of the renal arteries where we can deliver either energy, perhaps medications, and even ultrasound energy has been looked at in terms of modulating the effect of both the afferent and efferent in those areas.</p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt; Insert Slide 3&gt;&gt; </strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt;  RDN</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Weber: </strong> That is fascinating. This is all predicated around the fact that the renal nerves are close to the renal artery. So, if we can put a catheter in the renal artery and put out energy or drugs, we should be able to destroy much or most of the renal nerves. So, just very quickly, for people who are not basic physiologist, how does that work?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Lee:</strong> A lot of the work has been done looking at things like norepinephrine levels, also activity that can be measured for the sympathetic nervous system and again the concept here is that we can deliver a device that will modulate and mitigate some of the over work of these renal nerves. And, by modulating that signal hopefully then we can get the desired response which is again a reduction in sympathetic tone and hopefully as a consequence of that a reduction in people's BP. </p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt; Insert Slide 4&gt;&gt; </strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt;  Renal Sympathetic Activation in Hypertension<sup>[3]</sup></strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Weber:</strong> Even though basic scientists have known for some time, a lot of people did not realize that the afferent nerves, which go from the kidney back up to the brain, have a big regulatory part of how the brain adjusts sympathetic activity for the whole body. </p>
    
    <p>So, if the kidney wants sympathetic activity increased, it sends that message, if it wants it decreased it sends another message. So, when we sever those nerves, assuming that there is too much sympathetic activity, then we ought to see a nice fall in pressure.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Lee:</strong> And we have seen that in some of the work that has been done. When you do measure these levels or measure sympathetic activity before and after performing a renal denervation we are seeing drops in that kind of activity and with those biomarkers.</p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt; Insert Slide 5&gt;&gt; </strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Other Methods of Ablation</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Weber: </strong>Now, as an interventionalist, you, you have seen some major changes in the technology that we are using and in particular the catheters that we are using.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Lee: </strong>Yes, so there is been a lot of interest in this field and it is not just as you eluded to, radiofrequency or using heat to help ablate the nerves, but now we have a number of other technologies including ultrasound, including injecting drugs into the parenchyma. </p>
    
    <p>I have also looked at external systems where people are delivery energy to try and ablate the nerved from an external source. So, it has been great to see the technology move forward, I do think that there is still work to do obviously to make this a commercially viable opportunity to help people with their BP.</p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt; Insert Slide 6&gt;&gt; </strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt;  SPYRAL Catheter<sup>[4,5]</sup></strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Weber: </strong>The SPYRAL catheter has been involved in most of the big trials in the last 2 or 3 years. Explain very quickly what is special about this SPYRAL catheter, why there is so much talk about it?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Lee:</strong> One of the things that we have learned is that with single point ablations we probably do not do enough in terms of ablations. </p>
    
    <p>So, if you look at the SYMPLICITY HTN data whether it is (trial number) 1, 2, or 3, what we are seeing is that we needed to do more ablations and two what was also important is that we do a 4-quadrant ablation that is do circumferential ablation of these nerves. </p>
    
    <p>And so that is what lead to the development of the SPYRAL catheter which is a soft, relatively easy to use catheter. It has four points on it that allow us to circumferentially do the ablation and make sure that we get nerves in all 4 different quadrants when we are looking down the vessel.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Weber:</strong> What is fascinating to me as well is, as you got a better understanding of anatomy and saw that many of the renal nerve fibers get very close to the renal artery, even after it bifurcates, we now are able to go into the branches, right? How far can you go with the catheter?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Lee: </strong>The technique also changed because back in 2005, when this was born, we had no idea how we would do this and what the possibilities were in terms of safety, efficacy. Also, we did not know whether we would need to do repeat ablations. </p>
    
    <p>We know that we probably do not need to do repeat ablations but what we have discovered, again, as a consequence of, of the science that has gone into understanding the anatomy is that, if we go further out and even toward the cortex of the kidney the nerves do come together and that perhaps is where we should target our therapies. </p>
    
    <p>And, that does mean too, also looking at branches and so forth, and as you know from the SPYRAL HTN data sets which have been published in <em>The Lancet</em><sup>[4,5]</sup>, both of those have, again, 40-plus ablations whereas we used to do maybe 16 to 18. And the data are actually quite impressive in terms of the reductions in BP as a consequence of that.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Weber:</strong> Absolutely. For the first time now, we are seeing significant effects that are clinically meaningful, the source of effects that would be associated with significant reductions in major events, which is what treating hypertension is all about. </p>
    
    <p>David, it has been a real pleasure talking to you and thank you for sharing your, your experiences. You have taught us a lot about why renal denervation really is perhaps a coming part of hypertension therapy.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Dr Lee: </strong>Thank you so much, it has been my pleasure.</p>
