<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Immunogenicity of Biologics in Chronic Inflammatory Diseases<sup>[6,7]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Approximately one-third of patients being treated with biologic therapy do not respond within the first year</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Multiple reasons</p>

<p>&#9642;	Primary or secondary nonresponses</p>

<p>&#8226;	The reported rate of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) that develop in patients receiving biologic therapy, either originator compounds or biosimilar compounds, varies greatly</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Differences are due to disparate bioanalytical methods and interpretation approaches, as well as a plethora of product-specific and patient-specific factors that are not fully understood</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>The incidence of ADAs cannot be generalized across products </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [6]; 03:09&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Complex Nature of ADAs<sup>[7]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Traditionally, neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies have been defined as:</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>A subset of binding ADAs that bind to the drug and inhibit its pharmacologic function by preventing target binding (neutralizing antibodies)</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>ADAs that bind to sites on the drug molecule that do not affect target binding and thereby do not impact the drug&#8217;s pharmacodynamic activity (non-neutralizing)</p>

<p>&#8226;	ADAs represent a very complex set of analytes</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [9]; 06:09; Note to EA &#8211; Chapter Title: Clinical Relevance of ADAs&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Impact of ADAs<sup>[6]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The clinical potential of ADAs is primarily within the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the biologic agent</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>A complex between the biologic agent and the drug antibodies is formed, which neutralizes part or all of the drug</p>

<p>&#8226;	What is relevant is that some patients make only a few molecules/antibodies against the therapeutic agent, resulting is a substantial amount of free drug to be available</p>

<p>&#8226;	In other patients, a large amount of molecules/antibodies are made against the drug complex, resulting in very little effect of the drug; the remaining active concentration may become zero</p>

<p>&#8226;	However, the bottom line is that if there is sufficient drug concentration to obtain the desired therapeutic effect, then the level of immunogenicity that occurs is not relevant</p>

<p>&#8226;	Injection site reactions do occur, but they are usually not mediated by ADAs</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; MTX Reduces Immunogenicity in a Dose-Dependent Manner<sup>[8]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The dose and timing of methotrexate (MTX) administration affects the rate of formation of ADA</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [12]; 11:55; Note to EA &#8211; Chapter Title: Biologic Agent Monitoring&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Biologic Agent Monitoring in Daily Practice<sup>[9]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	It is not necessary to routinely test for ADAs</p>

<p>&#8226;	Measurement of the serum drug concentration can be helpful</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>If the drug level is adequate, then the degree of ADA is not important; it will only lead to confusion</p>

<p>&#8226;	Measuring ADAs may be helpful to better understand why a drug concentration is low or absent</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Many test are available</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>If the ADA titer is high, that is a strong indication that immunogenicity is an important issue for the patient</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Model: ADA Development and Decreased Biologic Serum Concentration<sup>[10]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Most biologic agents have a half-life of approximately 3 weeks</p>

<p>&#8226;	After drug administration, a maximum concentration (Cmax) is reached</p>

<p>&#8226;	Important signal for immunogenicity: drug concentration appears to decrease more rapidly than is expected during elimination</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Biologic Agent Monitoring in Daily Practice<sup>[9]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The serum trough drug concentration should be used to assess therapeutic drug concentrations</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Can be inconvenient to obtain because it may involve patients returning to the clinic for an extra office visit</p>

<p>&#8226;	It is not only ADAs that contribute to drug nonresponse, but also other factors that cannot be easily assessed and quantified</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Response to Targeted Treatment in RA<sup>[11]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Some patients achieve complete response, while others achieve partial response or no response  </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [17]; 16:17&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Potential Predictors of Response to Anti-TNF Treatment<sup>[11]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	It is unknown why certain patients achieve different responses</p>

<p>&#8226;	There are several factors, which have been identified, that can help predict a response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment</p>

<p>&#8226;	Some differences occur once a patient has achieved a response</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Some patients maintain the response indefinitely</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Others lose response</p>

<p>&#9642;	Some lose the response gradually, and some seem to lose response quite suddenly </p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>There may be a role for doing an ADA test in these different subsets of patients</p>

<p>&#9642;	More research is needed to determine the optimal place for ADA testing</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [18]; 17:35&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Considerations for Patients With Loss of Response to Biologic Therapy</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	There is still a great deal to discuss regarding how best to use ADA testing</p>

<p>&#8226;	While it is not practical or cost-efficient to test all patients, ADA testing can provide information in certain patient populations, including patients who are not responding to treatment with a biologic agent</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>If the patient has no/low drug concentration, measure ADAs</p>

<p>&#9642;	If a high ADA titer is found, the drug is likely being cleared because of immunogenicity</p>

<p>&#9642;	The drug mechanism is not failing, but the specific drug is failing; can switch from 1 anti-TNF agent to another</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>If the patient&#8217;s drug concentration is at a good level, then consider that the target is blocked (drug mechanism is failing)</p>

<p>&#9642;	Switch to a drug with a different mechanism of action</p>

<p>&#8226;	If the patient is responding well, but a low drug concentration is present, there are 2 explanations</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>The patient is doing well and not taking his or her drugs </p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>The patient is doing well despite making ADAs and clearing the drug</p>

<p>&#9642;	In this case, there is no benefit to continuing the drug </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [19]; 19:29&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Reduction of Overexposure in Patients With RA and High Serum ADA Concentrations<sup>[12]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	A recent publication found that adalimumab-treated patients with RA with trough concentrations &gt; 8&#8201;&#181;g/mL can prolong their standard dosing interval to once every 3&#8201;weeks without loss of disease control</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [20]; 20:07&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; RA Treatment Based on Antibody Responses?</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Currently, specific dosing regimens of the individual biologic agents are licensed for use</p>

<p>&#8226;	This one-size-fits-all dosing is in contrast with individualized/tailored dosing according to the patient&#8217;s needs</p>

<p>&#8226;	Having a single dose available for all patients is pragmatic; it is the only way to do a randomized controlled trial (RCT)</p>

<p>&#8226;	However, it is the drug concentration that elicits an effect</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>If there is a large variation in the drug concentrations of biologic agents (originator or biosimilar), then one may consider that dosing based on drug concentration might be a better strategy</p>

<p>&#9642;	Treatment could be personalized</p>

<p>&#8226;	Personalized dosing is a good topic for research, but should not be used at this time</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>At present, it is difficult to endorse treatment based on antibody responses</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Serum Drug Levels of Biologic Agents in the Management of RA: A Systematic Review<sup>[13]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Data demonstrating that<strong> </strong>a particular concentration correlates to the particular response is lacking</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Particularly in a situation where we know that patients have quite variable immune systems </p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Data from the original dose-finding studies of the various biologic agents is needed</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [22]; 23:05&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Potential Predictors of Response to Anti-TNF Treatment<sup>[11]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Several factors help predict response to anti-TNF therapy</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Concomitant use of MTX</p>

<p>&#9642;	Patients on monotherapy, without using combination therapy with MTX, are at increased risk of developing neutralizing antibodies</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Patients with a higher body mass index require more bioavailability of the drug; they may need more drug to have an effect</p>

<p>&#9642;	May never develop ADAs</p>

<p>&#9642;	Probably more relevant for drug levels</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Patients with impaired renal function are more likely to retain the drug, leading to higher drug levels</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; EULAR Recommendations for the Management of RA With csDMARDs and bDMARDs<sup>[1]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Concomitant use of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), in particular, MTX, is important to produce the best response</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>MTX has an additive effect on efficacy in patients with RA</p>

<p>&#9642;	MTX also helps prevent formation of ADA</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt> The data are less clear regarding the beneficial effects of concomitant MTX in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Biosimilars and Their Reference Agents Are Interchangeable<sup>[14,15]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Biosimilar agents offer cost savings and health gains for patients with chronic rheumatic diseases such as RA</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Some physicians are cautious about the application in the real world</p>

<p>&#8226;	Clinicians can be more confident now using biosimilars</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Have several years of real-world data </p>

<p>&#8226;	There are no meaningful differences in the efficacy or the safety between originator compounds and biosimilar drugs </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [26]; 28:10&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; The Data Requirements for Biosimilar Approval Are Comprehensive<sup>[16]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	To qualify as a biosimilar, efficacy must be proven in a particular indication, and then the biosimilar would achieve the licensing indication across what the originators had originally achieved </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; NOR-SWITCH: Switching From Originator Infliximab to Biosimilar CT-P13<sup>[17]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Upon review of real-world data, such as NOR-SWITCH, there are no meaningful differences in terms of efficacy when switching from an originator to the biosimilar</p>

<p>&#8226;	Interestingly, at a recent European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) meeting, there was a report of patients who switched from the originator etanercept to the biosimilar etanercept, and then roughly 15% to 17% switched back to the originator etanercept</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>There were no definitive reasons for the switch back</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>The authors concluded that there were several subjective reasons why the patients switched back, suggesting that there could have been a nocebo effect on the part of the patients and maybe even some subconscious influence from the physicians</p>

<p>&#9642;	The switch back to originator etanercept is unlikely to be due to an immunogenicity-related lack of efficacy </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; RCTs of Switching From Originator Infliximab to Biosimilar Infliximab in RA<sup>[18,19]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Rates of immunogenicity were similar in the original infliximab biosimilar studies, PLANET-RA and PLANET-AS</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>This makes sense from an immunologic standpoint and understanding of what the biosimilar concept is all about; that the it is an identical protein with variations that are not related to immunogenicity</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Recommendations Regarding the Use of Biosimilars in Patients With RA<sup>[1,20]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Mark Lazarus, PhD, MRCP: We have been switching patients to the biosimilars in our practice; we are comfortable with switching and have seen very good results</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>I have not observed any major complications from switching</p>

<p>&#8226;	The EULAR guidelines for the treatment of patients with RA state that biosimilars should be used in agreement with the patient</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>However, once the physician and patient have agreed to use a biosimilar, it is basically the very similar molecule/effect</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Use of Biosimilars: Discussion Points With Patients<sup>[16]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	In general, patients are happy with the switch from biologic to biosimilar</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Can switch back if efficacy is lost; have reassurance</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Very few patients refuse to change</p>

<p>&#8226;	Gertjan Wolbink, MD: in our institute, if EMA- or FDA-approved biosimilar agents are available, we use the biosimilar drug, which is generally lower in cost</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>If an originator biologic agent is lower in cost, we would use that agent as well</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Biosimilar Switching: Evidence From Arthritis Studies<sup>[14,17,21,22]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Based on studies, such as<strong> </strong>NOR-SWITCH and others, the efficacy and safety of biosimilar agents for the treatment of patients with RA has been established</p>

<p>&#8226;	Not all patients receiving originator biologic will achieve 100% response over a year</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>It is the same for the biosimilar drugs; not all patients will achieve 100% response </p>

<p>&#9642;	Anticipate</p>

<p>&#9642;	Discuss this fact with patients</p>

<p>&#8226;	Hector Chinoy, PhD, FRCP: I agree with the EULAR guidelines for the treatment of patients with RA</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>I think that it is very important to keep the patient involved with the decision-making process</p>

<p>&#9642;	Biosimilar agents are not just the cheapest drug; they offer the best value package </p>

<p>&#9642;	Patients may have a preference regarding drug delivery device; there are subtle differences between the originator and the biosimilar</p>

<p>&#8226;	Biosimilar agents can be used in several diseases, including PsA and axSpA</p>
