<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Potential Predictors of Response to Anti-TNF Treatment<sup>[11]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Several factors help predict response to anti-TNF therapy</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Concomitant use of MTX</p>

<p>&#9642;	Patients on monotherapy, without using combination therapy with MTX, are at increased risk of developing neutralizing antibodies</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Patients with a higher body mass index require more bioavailability of the drug; they may need more drug to have an effect</p>

<p>&#9642;	May never develop ADAs</p>

<p>&#9642;	Probably more relevant for drug levels</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Patients with impaired renal function are more likely to retain the drug, leading to higher drug levels</p>
