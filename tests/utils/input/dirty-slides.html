<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Potential Predictors of Response to Anti-TNF Treatment<sup>[11]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	It is unknown why certain patients achieve different responses</p>

<p>&#8226;	There are several factors, which have been identified, that can help predict a response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment</p>

<p>&#8226;	Some differences occur once a patient has achieved a response</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Some patients maintain the response indefinitely</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Others lose response</p>

<p>&#9642;	Some lose the response gradually, and some seem to lose response quite suddenly </p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>There may be a role for doing an ADA test in these different subsets of patients</p>

<p>&#9642;	More research is needed to determine the optimal place for ADA testing</p>
