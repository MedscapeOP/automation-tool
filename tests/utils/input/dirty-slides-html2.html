<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 5; 02:30&gt;&gt; </strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Undertreatment in Real-World Settings Can Lead to Suboptimal Gains in Vision<sup>[2-15]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	There is a huge burden for treatment visits</p>

<p>&#8226;	There is a need for better optimized patient outcomes, such as a drug that is longer lasting, that would be more efficacious of drying the macula</p>

<p>&#8226;	Real-world registries didn't achieve the similar results as in the pivotal large-scale prospective randomized trials </p>

<p>&#8226;	Injection frequency is lower in the real world (real-world evidence studies, registries) compared to clinical trials</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 6; 03:45&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Real-World Evidence Shows that Over 70% of Patients with nAMD are Undertreated in the First Year of Therapy<sup>[11,15]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Full funding in Australia delivered outcomes close to clinical trials</p>

<p>&#8226;	Within Europe, a different funding system resulted in differences in outcome</p>

<p>&#8226;	Fewer injections resulted in worse outcomes</p>

<p>&#8226;	Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) outcomes in China and South America have been affected negatively by reimbursement issues for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Observational Study of FRB Database Eyes: Adherence to Treatment May Improve Results<sup>[16]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	More injections are associated with better results</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; The Number of Injections Affects VA Results<sup>[17]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	There are 3 different silos of opportunity: </p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Provide patients initially with better vision</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Have a greater durability of the treatment</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Have a long-lasting effect</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 9; 06:02&gt;&gt; </strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Objectives of the Treatment<sup>[1]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The treatment objective is to:</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Improve anatomical outcomes</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Dry the retina</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Minimize retinal fluid (to improve vision clinically)</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Then maintain results with less frequent treatment regimens</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 10; 07:01&gt;&gt; </strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Real-World Evidence Highlights the Relationship Between Injection Frequency and VA Gains<sup>[18-19]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The next question is to evaluate if it is possible to stop the treatment in some patients</p>

<p>&#8226;	More research on that topic is needed</p>

<p>&#8226;	The recurrence rate is at least 50% in the first year (when treatment is stopped)</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Sustain Treatment: Adequate and Continued Anti-VEGF Therapy Can Maintain Long-Term Vision in the Real World<sup>[15-16]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The majority of patients need long-term treatment</p>

<p>&#8226;	We have no predictive markers to tell in a given patient whether or not to stop treatment, or if they will recur 6 or 12 months later</p>

<p>&#8226;	Studies in which patients do well -- and there is some remaining fluid -- were the end result of trials attempting to do everything possible to eradicate the fluid</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Molecular Sizes of Anti-VEGF Agents<sup>[20-25]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Brolucizumab was designed to achieve longer durability, with less injection frequency, through a concentrated molar dosing enabled by a smaller molecular size</p>

<p>&#8226;	Brolucizumab is the most advanced single-chain antibody variable fragment developed for ophthalmic use</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 14; 11:20&gt;&gt; </strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; HAWK and HARRIER Studies: Brolucizumab Reduced Dosing Frequency<sup> [26]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The aim was to achieve a longer-term effect in the eye and to be potentially more efficacious</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 15; 11:40&gt;&gt; </strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Patients treated with brolucizumab 6 mg had&#160;fewer visits in which&#160;sub-RPE fluid was observed from Week 36 to 48 <sup>[25]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	When examining the optical coherence tomography (OCT), and the fluid that is intraretinal and/or subretinal as well as sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), there was an approximately 30% greater reduction in the OCT with brolucizumab compared to aflibercept</p>

<p>&#8226;	What those results suggest is that, given the molecular structure of the drug, brolucizumab has the potential to anatomically work more favorable versus aflibercept</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Conbercept for Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to nAMD: The PHOENIX Study<sup>[27]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Conbercept is a large recombinant fusion protein with an anti-VEGF activity </p>

<p>&#8226;	The PHOENIX trial demonstrated a significant improvement of visual acuity (VA) on conbercept in Chinese nAMD patients</p>

<p>&#8226;	Abicipar pegol could potentially allow for 12 weeks of retreatment cycles</p>

<p>&#8226;	Abicipar pegol led to a high inflammation rate of about 15%</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Phase 2 Studies Using RG7716<sup>[28-30]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	RG7716 is a bi-specific molecule with 2 fragment antigen-binding (Fab) arms</p>

<p>&#8226;	One Fab arm is an anti-VEGF and the other is an anti-angiotensin (Ang)-2, with a modified fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Patients treated with brolucizumab 6 mg had significantly&#160;fewer visits in which&#160;IRF and/or SRF was observed from Week 36 to 48<sup>[25]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Brolucizumab was shown to be noninferior in mean BCVA change from baseline to he primary endpoint of week 48, despite over 50% patients on the brolucizumab 6mg arm were treated on a q12w dosing immediately after loadingThere was a week 16 comparison that was very impactful because it allowed for a matched comparison based on identical dosing for brolucizumab and aflibercept</p>

<p>&#8226;	From an anatomic point of view, brolucizumab was superior to aflibercept</p>

<p>&#8226;	Brolucizumab significantly reduces central subfield thickness compared to aflibercept at 16 weeks </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Phase 3 CEDAR and SEQUOIA<sup>[33]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Abicipar is a 36 kDa molecule</p>

<p>&#8226;	The problem with abicipar is inflammation</p>

<p>&#8226;	A majority of patients could be early extended to injections every 12 weeks</p>

<p>&#8226;	The phase 3 studies -- CEDAR and SEQUOIA -- indicate that patients were stabilized, but more information on patient VA evolution is needed</p>

<p>&#8226;	In both studies, there was a 15% inflammation rate</p>

<p>&#8226;	Safety is key in this area of treatment, especially with long-term treatment over 10 or 20 years with repeated injections </p>

<p>&#8226;	The reported incidence of inflammation with conbercept is not high </p>

<p>&#8226;	Conbercept, a fusion protein, has great binding capacity, but did not show improved efficacy over other available agents Phase 3 trials are now starting in the United States and Europe</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Targeting Key Angiogenic Pathways With RG7716<sup>[34]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	RG7716 is an anti-Ang-2/anti-VEGF dual molecule that has 2 Fab segments that combat the 2 parts of the pathological process Hypothetically, there is an interplay between VEGF-A and Ang-2</p>

<p>&#8226;	The Fc portion has 6 mutations and has been optimized to decrease the amount of systemic exposure and inflammation</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; RG7716 in the BOULEVARD Study<sup>[35]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The BOULEVARD study included patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) and showed very good results on macular edema</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 27; 23:53&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Phase 2 Studies Using RG7716<sup>[28-30]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The AVENUE study included patients with nAMD and showed the same results as with ranibizumab</p>

<p>&#8226;	The STAIRWAY study included patients with nAMD and showed that 65% of patients have been extended to intervals of every 16 weeks </p>

<p>&#8226;	The promising part of RG7716 is that it works via the tyrosine kinase receptor and integrins</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Phase 1/2a Data of OPT-302 in nAMD<sup>[36]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	OPT-302 is a pan-VEGF inhibitor</p>

<p>&#8226;	Other agents that suppress VEGF-A are associated with an upregulation of VEGF-C and VEGF-D </p>

<p>&#8226;	This upregulation may add to the resistance to VEGF-A mono-suppression -- which has been described in cancers (such as lung and colon cancer)</p>

<p>&#8226;	In a 3-month study, OPT-302 showed that half of the patients had undetectable neovascular membranes </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Gene Therapy: The Example of RGX-314<sup>[37]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Most drugs and approaches using gene therapy in ocular and systemic disease have failed</p>

<p>&#8226;	The eye is the ideal organ on which to perform gene therapy and there have been successes in monogenetic rare retinal dystrophies</p>

<p>&#8226;	nAMD is a highly-attractive pathology for gene therapy</p>

<p>&#8226;	The idea behind gene therapy in nAMD is to trigger protein production from cells that mimic an anti-VEGF effect rather than aiming to replace a faulty gene</p>

<p>&#8226;	RGX-314 uses the AAV8 virus, which specifically delivers the gene to the retina</p>

<p>&#8226;	RGX-314 is an anti-VEGF Fab</p>
