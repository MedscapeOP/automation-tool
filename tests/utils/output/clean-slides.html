<h3> Severe Trauma and Uncontrolled Bleeding<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>

<li>	It is important to identify, and then to rapidly and appropriately treat, trauma-associated coagulopathy</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 5&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;Note to EA &#8211; Chapter Title: Goal-Directed Coagulation Management&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:01:56&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Key Decisions in a Goal-Directed Coagulation Management Approach</h3>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 6&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:02:13&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Polling Question 1</h3>

<li>	Which of the following is most frequently abnormal and needs immediate correction in a severely injured patient? </li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 7&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:02:36&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>The Vessel Wall and Platelet-Plug Formation in the Context of Damage<sup type="ref">[2]</sup></h3>

<li>	In the physiologic state, plasma-borne coagulation factors such as platelets and sub-endothelial matrix coagulation factors such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) are nicely separated by the endothelium. As long as the endothelium is intact, there is no coagulation</li>

<li>	However, that changes in the context of endothelial damage

<ul><li>	The resulting coagulation cascade involves the binding of vWF to collagen, platelet activation, and adherence</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 8&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:04:14&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Excessive Perioperative Bleeding: Role of Fibrin Monomers and Factor XIII<sup type="ref">[3,4]</sup></h3>

<li>	Activated platelets provide a highly efficient surface for activated coagulation factors, enabling the thrombin burst<sup type="ref">[2]</sup></li>

<li>	The thrombin burst, which is sudden and violent, transforms soluble fibrin into fibrinogen, an essential component in the coagulation cascade, responsible for linking activated platelets</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 9&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:05:12&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Fibrinogen and Hemostasis in Massive Bleeding<sup type="ref">[5]</sup></h3>

<li>	Fibrinogen is the coagulation element that is the first to become critically reduced in many trauma situations

<ul><li>	Accordingly, it is important to realize that, unlike red blood cells (RBCs) or platelets, there are no fibrinogen stores in the body</li></ul></li>

<li>	In ongoing bleeding, when blood is replaced with crystalloids or colloids, hemoglobin eventually stabilizes because RBCs are being mobilized; similarly, platelets stabilize and increase</li>

<li>	However, this is not the case for fibrinogen; and therefore, exogenous fibrinogen needs to be introduced</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 10&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:07:01&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Is FFP Clinically Effective?<sup type="ref">[6]</sup></h3>

<li>	When there is bleeding, many clinicians think of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)</li>

<li>	However, any number of studies going back for decades have questioned the utility of FFP in treating coagulopathy associated with trauma or cardiac surgery</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 11&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:08:24&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Concerns Vis-&Agrave;-Vis FFP<sup> [7-11]</sup></h3>

<li>	Transfusions of FFP are associated with a number of deleterious outcomes</li>

<li>	However, perhaps the main reason not to use FFP is that it is ineffective in the treatment of coagulopathy</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 12&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:09:07&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Considerable Differences Exist Between Clauss-Based Plasma Fibrinogen Measured Using Different Detection Methods<sup type="ref">[12]</sup></h3>

<li>	Lab measurement of fibrinogen Levels can vary widely</li>

<li>	Moreover, valuable time may be lost while awaiting the results from laboratory analyses</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 13&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:09:51&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Diagnostics: Viscoelastic Techniques<sup type="ref">[13]</sup></h3>

<li>	Assessment technologies such as thrombelastography (TEG) or rotational thrombelastography (ROTEM) can quickly ascertain coagulation factor Levels and shortfalls</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 14&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:10:39&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Point-Of-Care Coagulation Testing vs Conventional Coagulation Analyses<sup> [14]</sup></h3>

<li>	Weber and colleagues conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing 2 methods of assessing hemostatic therapy efficacy</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 15&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:11:13&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Results: Point-Of-Care Testing in Cardiac Surgery Patients<sup type="ref">[14]</sup></h3>

<li>	Compared with conventional coagulation analyses, point-of-care testing has fewer transfusions of RBCs, fewer FFP transfusions, and a similar number of fibrinogen units per patient. Cost of point-of-care testing was considerably less than conventional coagulation analyses</li>

<li>	Point-of-care coagulation testing group vs the conventional coagulation analyses group had shorter postoperative ventilation times and lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, lower incidence of composite adverse events, and lower mortality during a 6-month follow-up</li>

<li>	Point-of-care coagulation testing also reduced allogenic blood transfusion vs conventional coagulation analyses </li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 16&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:12:06&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>The PROPPR Study: Plasma, Platelets, and RBC Transfusion Ratios<sup> [15]</sup></h3>

<li>	If FFP is ineffective for the treatment of coagulopathy, what about ratios of RBCs, platelets, and plasma</li>

<li>	PROPPR compared 2 transfusion ratios and found them to be similar, and yet it is likely that both ratios are inferior to a goal-directed treatment approach to coagulopathy, where the focus is replenishment of coagulation factors at low Levels in the individual patient</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 17&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:13:07&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>The PROPPR Study: Outcomes Results<sup type="ref">[15]</sup></h3>

<li>	No significant differences were observed between the 1:1:1 and the 1:1:2 transfusion ratios in terms of mortality</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 18&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:13:50&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>1:1:1 Magic for the Uneducated?<sup type="ref">[16]</sup></h3>

<li>	The laboratory results-guided transfusion protocol was associated with reduced all-cause 28-day mortality compared with the fixed ratio (1:1:1) transfusion protocol group</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 19&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:14:36&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>European Trauma Treatment Guidelines: Recommendation 12, Coagulation Monitoring<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>

<li>	These guidelines have been scientifically cited nearly 1400 times</li>

<li>	Each word of the recommendation is important, particularly the admonition to monitor <em>early </em>and <em>repeatedly</em></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 20&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:15:33&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Tranexamic Acid and Coagulation<sup type="ref">[17]</sup></h3>

<li>	This trial tested the utility of administering tranexamic acid to achieve coagulation in trauma patients</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 21&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:16:21&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Prehospital Tranexamic Acid Study: On-Scene to Hospital Admission<sup type="ref">[17]</sup></h3>

<li>	Maximum clot formation deteriorated in the group of trauma patients who did not receive tranexamic acid</li>

<li>	Pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that 90 minutes after the initial dose, 1 g of tranexamic acid should be redosed to maintain the clot-formation threshold</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 22&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:17:01&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>European Trauma Treatment Guidelines: Recommendation 26: Goal-Directed Therapy<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>

<li>	The application of an individualized, goal-directed coagulation strategy is of central importance, as is the utility of the viscoelastic methods for assessing coagulation</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 23&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:17:26&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>European Trauma Treatment Guidelines: Recommendation 28 Fibrinogen &amp; Cryoprecipitate<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>

<li>	The guidelines recommend maintaining fibrinogen Levels at the minimum of 1.5 to 2 g/L</li>

<li>	Be aware that these Levels do not induce a hypercoagulable state post-operatively

<ul><li>	This was shown in a study by Schlimp and colleagues<sup type="ref">[18]</sup></li>

<li>	Treatment of severe trauma patients with fibrinogen concentrate during bleeding management in the first 24 h after hospital admission did not lead to higher plasma fibrinogen Levels post-trauma, beyond that occurring naturally due to the acute phase response

<ul><li>	The acute phase response, which involves upregulated fibrinogen synthesis in the liver, is something that occurred in both study groups</li></ul></li></ul></li>

 

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 24&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:19:03&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Two Treatment Concepts Compared Over Time<sup type="ref">[19]</sup></h3>

<li>	This retrospective, observational study by Stein and colleagues compared coagulation-management results before and after implementation of individualized, goal-directed coagulation transfusion protocols

<ul><li>	The new protocols included individualized coagulation management, damage control surgery, restrictions on fluid resuscitation, and use of tranexamic acid</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 25&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:19:39&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Point-Of-Care Coagulation Monitoring in Trauma Patients: Coagulation Algorithm<sup type="ref">[19]</sup></h3>

<li>	The individualized, goal-directed coagulation management algorithm was deliberately designed to be uncomplicated

<ul><li>	Eg, if fibrinogen thromboelastometry (FIBTEM) was at 7 or below, fibrinogen was administered</li>

<li>	Eg, any signs of lysis would result in administration of tranexamic acid</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 26&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:20:12&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Incidence of Massive Transfusion: 2 Treatment Concepts Compared Over Time<sup type="ref">[19]</sup></h3>

<li>	The individualized, goal-directed coagulation management algorithm reduced the massive transfusion to one-half that predicted by trauma-associated severe hemorrhage (TASH)</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 27&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:20:52&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Allogeneic Blood Products and Coagulation Factors (%): 2 Treatment Concepts Compared Over Time<sup type="ref">[19]</sup></h3>

<li>	The individualized, goal-directed coagulation management algorithm reduced administration of RBCs and also of FFP

<ul><li>	The new protocol also increased the administration of tranexamic acid and Factor VIII (FVIII)</li>

<li>	More importantly, the individualized, goal-directed coagulation management algorithm significantly reduced ICU stay and need for ventilator support (<em>P</em> &lt;.001 for both parameters)</li>

<li>	Both mortality on day 1 and in-hospital mortality were significantly reduced by the application of the individualized, goal-directed coagulation management algorithm <em>(P</em> =.001 and <em>P</em> &lt;.001, respectively)</li></ul></li>

<h3>Summary and Conclusions</h3>

<h3> Evidence for Using First-Line Coagulation Factor Concentrates for Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy</h3>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 30&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:23:44&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Polling Question 2</h3>

<li>	Which of the following is true for FFP?</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 31&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:25:16&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Important Questions</h3>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 32&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:25:47&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>The Main Players in Coagulation<sup type="ref">[20]</sup></h3>

<li>	Note that fibrinogen is involved in all aspects of the coagulation process, from platelet aggregation to thrombin generation, and stable clot formation</li>

<li>	Absent or depleted Levels of fibrinogen may even lead to the paradoxical situation of coagulopathic bleeding, but with concomitant elevated thromboembolic risk - a situation observed in patients with fibrinogen anemia</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 33&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:26:52&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Acquired Coagulopathy<sup type="ref">[21]</sup></h3>

<li>	In acquired coagulopathy, blood loss, fluid dilution, and factor consumption are present, with consumption mainly affecting fibrinogen and platelets</li>

<li>	In patients with very severe trauma, hypoprofusion may be a problem, as well as acidosis, which is associated with decreased Levels of fibrinogen and platelets</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 34&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:29:33&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>What Stops the Bleeding?<sup type="ref">[21]</sup></h3>

<li>	If the answer is &quot;concentration of coagulation factors,&quot; then adding plasma would be the answer</li>

<li>	However, if the answer is &quot;the clot&quot; (which is mainly built up by fibrinogen), then adding plasma would not be very helpful</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 35&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:30:11&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Prevalence and Impact of Abnormal ROTEM Assays in Severe Blunt Trauma<sup type="ref">[22]</sup></h3>

<li>	This was a prospective cohort study of patients with blunt trauma (isolated brain injury or polytrauma)

<ul><li>	The question the study hoped to answer was which is the most predominant coagulation pathology in patients with blunt force trauma?</li>

<li>	The finding was that, particularly in the patients with polytrauma, there was a significant increase in the frequency of low fibrinogen and fibrin polymerization, and poor clot firmness</li>

<li>	These deficits were associated with greater blood loss and mortality</li>

<li>	It was also noted that thrombin generation is greatly increased in these trauma patients, which would be even more increased, and not beneficially, by plasma administration</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 36&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:32:26&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Fibrinogen Levels Are an Independent Predictor of Mortality in Patients With Major Trauma<sup type="ref">[23]</sup></h3>

<li>	Correlations between fibrinogen Levels and mortality have also been reported in other studies, including this one of patients with major trauma in Australia</li>

<li>	A similar correlation of mortality and low fibrinogen Levels in trauma patients was reported by Hagemo and colleagues in a prospective, multicenter cohort study designed to evaluate the functional definition and characteristics of acute traumatic coagulopathy<sup type="ref">[24]</sup></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 37&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:33:38&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Plasma Transfusions in Clinical Practice</h3>

<li>	Plasma has been used since the 1940s in trauma cases, initially as a volume expander, but also as a means of treating coagulation disorders</li>

<li>	However, plasma infusion has many drawbacks</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 38&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:36:15&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Administration of Fibrinogen Concentrate in Clinical Practice</h3>

<li>	Fibrinogen concentrate has many of the virtues plasma lacks, including a better safety profile</li>

<li>	Meanwhile, some of its alleged drawbacks (eg, increased risk of thromboembolism) are mischaracterized

<ul><li>	Increased risk of thromboembolism may be observed with prothrombin complex concentrates administration, but not with fibrinogen (also known as anti-thrombin 1)</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 39&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:37:57&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Optimal Treatment of Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy? <em>Recommendations From the European Trauma Treatment Guidelines</em><sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>

<li>	However, the guidelines still recommend plasma (and RBCs) or fibrinogen (and RBCs) for the treatment of trauma-induced coagulopathy</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 40&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:38:53&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Are Coagulation Factor Concentrates Useful in Trauma Patients?<sup type="ref">[25-29]</sup></h3>

<li>	Although there are not many studies assessing the utility of coagulation factor concentrates in coagulopathy (and most are retrospective), results vs FFP consistently show lower mortality than predicted, lower incidences of multi-organ failure, and reduced transfusion requirements in patients who received fibrinogen concentrates or coagulation factor concentrates vs FFP</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 41&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:40:20&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Is FFP Effective? Results of a Systematic Review and Other Studies<sup type="ref">[30,31]</sup></h3>

<li>	FFP in bleeding patients tells a different story, 1 demonstrating no clear benefit with respect to blood loss, transfusion requirements, or mortality</li>

<li>	Findings are perhaps not clear with respect to a benefit of the use of fixed ratios of FFP to packed red blood cells (PRBCs), with some studies showing benefit and others showing neutral or even harmful results<sup type="ref">[30,31]</sup></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 42&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:41:20&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Mortality in Trauma? 1:1:1(2) vs POCT-Directed Individualized Therapy<sup type="ref">[11,15,32-33]</sup></h3>

<li>	Mortality of patients aggressively transfused with ratios of plasma: RBCs: platelets still remains high, particularly when compared with mortality rates in patients treated with targeted coagulation correction mainly using coagulation factor concentrates</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 43&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:42:21&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Comparison of FFP vs CFC For Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy<sup type="ref">[11]</sup></h3>

<li>	This was the first study comparing efficacy and safety of FFP vs coagulation factor concentrates in patients with severe trauma</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 44&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:43:05&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Main Findings: FFP vs CFC: RETIC Study<sup type="ref">[11]</sup></h3>

<li>	Treatment success: correction of coagulation/bleeding cessation occurred in 96% of patients administered clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) vs 52% of those who received FFP</li>

<li>	The percentage of patients requiring massive transfusion in the FFP group was more than double the percentage in the CFC group</li>

<li>	Setting aside confounders such as severity of trauma and presence of brain injury, multi-organ failure occurred in significantly fewer patients in the CFC group, despite the limited participant population of 94 patients</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 45&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:45:26&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> What Stops the Bleeding? (cont)</h3>

<li>	To return to our question: what stops the bleeding?</li>

<li>	Is it the concentrations of coagulation factors as in FFP; or is it clot strength associated with fibrinogen?</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 46&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:46:23&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Comparative Results From the RETIC Study<sup type="ref">[11]</sup></h3>

<li>	The box plots show baseline values and changes from baseline based on treatment for a number of coagulation parameters</li>

<li>	Despite patients in the FFP group receiving more RBCs and platelets, these patients had a dramatic drop in platelet counts</li>

<li>	In the CFC group, fibrinogen increased to normal Levels, but those Levels changed only marginally and remained below normal in the FFP group</li>

<li>	Consequently, clot strength improved rapidly in the CFC group, but remained unchanged or even reduced in the FFP group</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 47&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:47:35&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Summary and Conclusions</h3>

<h3> Implementation of a Revised Trauma Management Protocol</h3>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 49&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:49:38&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Polling Question 3</h3>

<li>	Which one of the following is associated with massive transfusion packages (1:1:1) in coagulation management?</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 50&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:50:36&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Can Guidelines Direct our Strategy? European Society of Anaesthesiology<sup type="ref">[34]</sup></h3>

<li>	Guidelines caution against an indiscriminate use of plasma in cases of perioperative bleeding management</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 51&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:51:16&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Can Guidelines Direct our Strategy? European Guideline on Management of Major Bleeding and Coagulopathy Following Trauma<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>

<li>	The European Guideline on the Management of Major Bleeding clearly recommends administration of fibrinogen concentrates when evidence exists of fibrinogen deficits</li>

<li>	Although there is a recommendation for initial administration of plasma, there is also a recommendation that plasma administration be avoided in patients not experiencing substantial bleeding</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 52&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:52:18&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Coagulopathy in Trauma Patients<sup type="ref">[35]</sup></h3>

<li>	What we know is that coagulopathy kills

<ul><li>	It is associated with nearly twice as much mortality compared with that of trauma patients without coagulopathy; and that is true regardless of injury severity score (ISS)</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 53&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:52:49&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Where Do We Go?</h3>

<li>	The rationale underlying 1:1:1 transfusion packages in coagulation management is that because the bleeding patient loses whole blood, you replace the whole blood with the 1:1:1 package

<ul><li>	Except the 1:1:1 transfusion package is not whole blood; rather it is anemic whole blood, thrombocytopenic and with depleted coagulation factors</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 54&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:53:32&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>FFP Is Not Efficacious in Bleeding Patients With Mildly Prolonged Coagulation Values<sup type="ref">[36]</sup></h3>

<li>	In this trial, patients were transfused with FFP for a pretransfusion prothrombin time (PT) between 13.1 and 17 seconds (international normalized ratio [INR], 1.1-1.85) and with a follow-up PT-INR within 8 hours of transfusion</li>

<li>	FFP transfusions failed to normalize PT-INR values</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 55&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:54:19&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Massive Transfusion Protocols: Survival Bias With High Ratio of FFP:PRBC?<sup type="ref">[37]</sup></h3>

<li>	This study questioned the apparent survival benefit of achieving a FFP to PRBC ratio of at least 1:2 in patients who required massive transfusion</li>

<li>	In fact, it was not that survival was improved by the fact that the patient received FFP, but rather that the patient was able to receive FFP because he or she had survived</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 56&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; Timecode: 00:54:56&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Fibrinogen Levels During Trauma Hemorrhage - Response to Replacement Therapy and Association With Patient Outcomes<sup type="ref">[38]</sup></h3>

<li>	In this trial, low Levels of fibrinogen upon hospital admission were associated with increased mortality</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 57&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:55:12&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Fibrinogen Levels and Patient Outcomes<sup type="ref">[38]</sup></h3>

<li>	It is now known that damage control resuscitation does not normalize fibrinogen Levels, despite the provision of high ratios of plasma and platelets</li>

<li>	In this trial, administration of cryoprecipitate (fibrinogen concentration of 7.4 g/L) was associated with improved survival</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 58&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:55:25&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Fibrinogen Levels Increased in Patients Receiving Both RBCs +FFP/PC and Cryoprecipitate<sup> [38]</sup></h3>

<li>	Even low Levels of fibrinogen were not sustainable in those patients receiving only plasma, RBCs, and platelets</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 59&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:56:00&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Damage Control Resuscitation Using Blood Component Therapy in Standard Doses Has a Limited Effect on Coagulopathy During Trauma Hemorrhage<sup type="ref">[39]</sup></h3>

<li>	Damage control resuscitation with blood components is not effective in coagulopathy

<ul><li>	In fact, in this study by Khan and colleagues, the percentage of patients with coagulopathy increased with the number of RBC transfusions</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 60&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:56:36&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> The Prospective, Observational, Multicenter, Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) Study: Comparative Effectiveness of a Time-Varying Treatment With Competing Risks<sup type="ref">[32]</sup></h3>

<li>	PROMMTT was a prospective cohort study designed to assess the correlation between trauma-related in-hospital mortality and early or time-varying transfusion of plasma and/or platelets and red blood cell ratios</li>

<li>	Early transfusion of blood products seemed to be associated with improved 24-hour survival, but not with long-term survival</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 61&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:56:56&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Relevant Studies in Patients With Severe Trauma<sup type="ref">[11,15,26,28,32]</sup></h3>

<li>	In studies evaluating FFP for the treatment of coagulopathy, the problem often is volume</li>

<li>	Coagulation factors are present in such low concentrations in FFP that massive transfusions would be required to increase coagulation factors to effective Levels

<ul><li>	However, the transfused volumes themselves can be harmful</li></ul></li>

<h3> FFP Complications: Transfusion of FFP in Critically Ill Surgical Patients Is Associated With an Increased Risk of Infection<sup type="ref">[9]</sup></h3>

<li>	In this study by Sarani and colleagues, FFP transfusion was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of infection compared with no FFP transfusion in critically ill surgical patients</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 63&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:58:32&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> FFP Complications:</strong> <strong>FFP Transfusion in Critically Ill Patients With Coagulopathy<sup type="ref">[40]</sup></h3>

<li>	In this study by Dara and colleagues, increased use of FFP was associated with an increased risk for a number of complications, including acute lung injury</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 64&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:58:50&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> FFP Complications: Impact of Plasma Transfusion in Trauma Patients Who Do Not Require Massive Transfusion<sup type="ref">[41]</sup></h3>

<li>	Even in patients who do not require massive transfusions, the use of FFP in this study by Inaba and colleagues demonstrated a linear relationship with complications - the greater the number of units transfused, the greater the incidence of complications</li>

<h3>Goal-Directed Hemostatic Resuscitation of Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy vs Conventional Coagulation Assays: Survival Variables<sup type="ref">[33]</sup></h3>

<li>	This was a randomized clinical trial to compare goal-directed therapy (viscoelastic TEG) with a massive transfusion protocol guided by conventional coagulation assays (CCAs)</li>

<li>	111 patients were included; primary outcome was 28-day survival</li>

<li>	Results:

<ul><li>	28-day survival in the TEG group was significantly higher than the CCA group (log-rank <em>P</em> =.032, Wilcoxon<em> P</em> =.027)</li>

<li>	In the CCA group, 20 deaths occurred (36.4%), compared with 11 deaths in the TEG group (19.6%; <em>P</em> =.049). Most deaths occurred within the first 6 hours from emergency department arrival; 12 deaths in the CCA group (21.8%), compared with 4 deaths in the TEG group (7.1%; <em>P</em> = 0.032)</li></ul></li>

<h3>Comparison of 2 Different Coagulation Algorithms: Results<sup type="ref">[42]</sup></h3>

<li>	Kaserer and colleagues conducted a retrospective, observational study comparing 2 different coagulation algorithms on the use of allogenic blood products and coagulation factors in severely injured trauma patients</li>

<li>	Both algorithms (1,2) are individualized, goal-directed coagulation and transfusion algorithms</li>

<li>	Main differences between the algorithms:

<ul><li>	A target hematocrit range (1) vs a lower hematocrit limit-only (2)</li>

<li>	Goal-directed coagulation algorithm (1) vs blind coagulation package (2)</li>

<li>	FXIII substitution considered early (1)</li></ul></li>
