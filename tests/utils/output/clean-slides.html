<h3> Introduction/Overview</h3>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 4 Note to EA &#8211; Chapter Title: The Evolution of Pathways and Targets in RA Timecode: 01:21:&gt;&gt;
<h3>Cytokines, Growth Factors, and Signaling Pathways Involved in RA Pathogenesis<sup type="ref">[1-3]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Many cytokines and growth factors converge upon the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in the furtherance of extracellular/intracellular communication</li>
<li>	In the rheumatoid synovial membrane, for example, Janus kinase (JAK) recruitment subsequently provokes STAT phosphorylation, which then facilitates nucleus translocation and gene expression</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 5 Timecode: 02:00&gt;&gt;
<h3> The Biological Significance of Signaling Through Different JAK Combinations<sup type="ref">[4-7]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Different combinations of cytokine ligands, JAKs, and STATs confer the possibility of different combinations of signals arriving at the cell nucleus, and thus of a wide range of information exchanges between the extracellular environment and the cell</li>
<li>	This in turn leads to a wide possibility of cell behaviors</li>
<li>	Contrast this with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway or interleukin (IL)-6 pathway, which is more discrete</li>
<li>	Therapeutically, this is not a problem, as it suggests the possibility of combinatorial approaches to block complementary pro-inflammatory pathways</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 6 Timecode: 03:44:&gt;&gt;
<h3>IL-6 in Inflammation, Immunity, and Disease<sup type="ref">[8-12]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The role of IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis may perhaps best be illustrated in the acute-phase response, with IL-6 implicated in elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and increases in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)</li>
<li>	Both CRP and ESR commonly accompany inflammatory disease in general and RA in particular</li>
<li>	IL-6 has also been implicated in joint destruction and in the systemic manifestations observed in RA, for example, anemia</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 7 Timecode: 04:50:&gt;&gt;
<h3>Tumor Necrosis Factor and the Pathogenesis of RA<sup type="ref">[13]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The role of TNF in autoimmune disorders was first elucidated some decades ago</li>
<li>	TNF plays a key role in the network of cellular and protein responses associated with inflammatory processes. Pathobiologically, these inflammatory responses are associated, in autoimmune joint diseases, with cartilage degradation, bone erosion, and joint destruction</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 8 Timecode: 05:59:&gt;&gt;
<h3>Selective JAK Inhibition: Advantages?<sup type="ref">[14]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The question as to whether or not selective inhibition of JAK, as opposed to more broad-brush inhibition of multiple kinases, would have advantages; such as, possibly, a cleaner safety profile</li>
<li>	Current research is striving to answer those questions</li>
</ul>

<h3>JAK Inhibitors in RA<sup type="ref">[15-18]</sup></h3>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 10 Timecode: 09:31&gt;&gt;
<h3>Tofacitinib and Baricitinib: Key Questions for JAK</h3>
<ul><li>	Optimizing dosing in various patient scenarios is the key question for JAK inhibitors</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 11 Timecode: 10:52:&gt;&gt;
<h3>Tofacitinib JAK 1/3 Inhibitor: Clinical Trials in RA<sup type="ref">[16,17,19,20]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Tofacitinib is a small-molecule JAK 1/3 inhibitor that has been approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of RA</li>
<li>	Tofacitinib's efficacy and safety have been assessed in a comprehensive clinical development program</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 12 Timecode: 11:32&gt;&gt;
<h3>Baricitinib: Key Studies in RA Phase 3 Program and Their Characteristics<sup type="ref">[21-24]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Baricitinib is a small-molecule JAK 1/2 inhibitor that has been approved by both the FDA and EMA for the treatment of RA</li>
<li>	Baricitinib's efficacy and safety have been assessed in a comprehensive clinical development program</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 13 Timecode: 12:38&gt;&gt;
<h3>EULAR Recommendations for RA Management<sup type="ref">[25]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Methotrexate remains the first-line treatment for RA</li>
<li>	Rheumatologists appreciate its good efficacy and safety record, as well as its huge titratable range, which means doses can be adjusted to patient specifics</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 14 Timecode: 14:46&gt;&gt;
<h3>Tofacitinib or ADA vs PBO in RA: Results From ORAL Standard<sup type="ref">[16]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	In ORAL Standard, a 12-month, phase 3 trial, 717 patients who were receiving stable doses of methotrexate were randomly assigned to 5 mg of tofacitinib twice daily, 10 mg of tofacitinib twice daily, 40 mg of adalimumab once every 2 weeks, or placebo</li>
<li>	Primary outcome measures were a 20% improvement at month 6 in the American College of Rheumatology 20 score (ACR20), the change from baseline to month 3 in health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI) score, and the percentage of patients at month 6 who had a disease activity score (DAS) of 28 or ESR of less than 2.6</li>
<li>	For the ACR20 score, both doses of tofacitinib were superior to adalimumab</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 15 Timecode: 16:31&gt;&gt;
<h3>RA-BUILD: Efficacy of Baricitinib in RA Patients With an Inadequate Response to csDMARDs<sup type="ref">[22]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	For many clinicians, the question becomes what to do for those patients who seem to have an inadequate response to first-line methotrexate: 1) replace methotrexate with another agent used as monotherapy, or 2) add a biologic to methotrexate?</li>
<li>	RA-BUILD was a phase 3, double-blind, 24-week study, wherein 684 biologics-naive patients with RA and an inadequate response to or intolerance of &#8805; 1 conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to placebo or baricitinib (2 or 4 mg) once daily</li>
<li>	Primary endpoints were changes in ACR20, DAS28, and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) </li>
<li>	At week 12, the ACR20 response was 62% for baricitinib 4 mg, and 59% for baricitinib 2 mg vs 39% for placebo (<em>P</em> &lt;.001); all study agents (including placebo) were added to stable background therapy</li>
<li>	The evidence seems to be that the add-on strategy is superior to switching between monotherapies</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 16 Timecode: 18:03&gt;&gt;
<h3>Baricitinib Monotherapy vs Methotrexate and Baricitinib + Methotrexate: RA-BEGIN<sup type="ref">[23]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	But not all the evidence</li>
<li>	In RA-BEGIN, for example, 588 patients were randomized 4:3:4 to receive methotrexate monotherapy (once weekly), baricitinib monotherapy (4 mg once daily), or the combination for 52 weeks</li>
<li>	For many of the study endpoints, including HAQ-DI, the treatment effects observed for baricitinib monotherapy and the combination of baricitinib and methotrexate were statistically similar, and both were superior to methotrexate monotherapy </li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 17 Timecode: 19:39&gt;&gt;
<h3>RA-BEAM Phase 3: ACR Outcomes at Weeks 12 and 24<sup type="ref">[24]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	RA-BEAM was a phase 3, 52-week, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial in which 1307 patients with active RA on background methotrexate were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 regimens in a 3:3:2 ratio: placebo (switched to baricitinib after 24 weeks), 4 mg of baricitinib once daily, or 40 mg of adalimumab every other week</li>
<li>	Baricitinib demonstrated statistically significant superiority vs adalimumab in ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses at week 12</li>
<li>	This study was the first to show that a targeted therapy &#8212; in this case, an oral, once daily, small molecule &#8212; was actually better than the standard of care, methotrexate plus adalimumab</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 18 Timecode: 20:49&gt;&gt;
<h3>Adalimumab for RA: Results From the PREMIER Trial<sup type="ref">[26]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	PREMIER was a double-blind, active comparator&#8211;controlled study of 799 (methotrexate-naive) RA patients with active disease of &lt; 3 years&#8217; duration</li>
<li>	Treatments included adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week plus methotrexate, adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week, or weekly oral methotrexate</li>
<li>	Significantly more patients (62%, <em>P</em> &lt;.001) on the combination of adalimumab and methotrexate achieved an ACR50 response vs patients on adalimumab alone or methotrexate alone</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 19 Timecode: 21:59&gt;&gt;
<h3>ACR50 Responses Tofacitinib Monotherapy vs Tofacitinib + MTX and Adalimumab + MTX: ORAL Strategy<sup type="ref">[27]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	In this trial, monotherapy tofacitinib was not found to be noninferior to the combination of adalimumab or tofacitinib with methotrexate, but it was also not found to be inferior to those combinations in terms of primary endpoint results (ie, ACR50 response at month 6)
<ul><li>	&#8220;Not noninferior&#8221; is a difficult concept. What is clear is that tofacitinib monotherapy does very well in some patients, but the combination of either tofacitinib or adalimumab with methotrexate does better</li></ul></li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 20&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;Note to EA &#8211; Chapter Title: JAK Inhibitors: PROs and Safety Issues Timecode: 22:51&gt;&gt;
<h3>PROs: RA-BEAM Phase 3 Trial of Baricitinib<sup type="ref">[28]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	A number of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are now being routinely assessed in many clinical trials. And these assessments make use of a variety of measurement tools and indices</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 21 Timecode: 23:34&gt;&gt;
<h3>Patient Assessment of Joint Pain Reduction<sup type="ref">[29]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The study by Louder and colleagues assessed patient preferences regarding RA agent attributes</li>
<li>	Joint pain reduction is one of the most important patient-reported preferences</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 22 Timecode: 24:40&gt;&gt;
<h3>RA-BEAM: Joint Pain Reduction<sup type="ref">[30]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	In RA-BEAM, joint pain reduction was one of the secondary endpoints measured</li>
<li>	Pain reduction occurred more rapidly and with greater magnitude in the baricitinib plus methotrexate arm</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 23 Timecode: 27:04&gt;&gt;
<h3>RA-BEACON: Baricitinib in RA Patients With an Inadequate Response to TNF&#945; Inhibitors<sup type="ref">[21]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	RA-BEACON involved 527 patients with an inadequate response or unacceptable side effects with 1 or more TNF inhibitors, other biologics, or both</li>
<li>	Patients were randomized to placebo, baricitinib 2 mg, or baricitinib 4 mg once daily for 24 weeks</li>
<li>	In these difficult-to-manage patients, 55% of the baricitinib 4 mg arm achieved an ACR20 response at week 12 vs 27% of placebo patients (<em>P</em> &lt;.001)</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 24 Timecode: 28:31&gt;&gt;
<h3>JAK Inhibitors: Safety Considerations<sup type="ref">[16,17,19-22,24,31,32]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Infections have been noted with JAK inhibitors, but to no greater extent than that noted for other biologics inhibiting the immune response</li>
<li>	An elevation in herpes zoster risk has been observed, but, clinically, a substantial enhancement of zoster reactivation has not been reported</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 25 Timecode: 29:40&gt;&gt;
<h3>RA Is Associated with an Approximately 2-Fold Increase in VTE Over Healthy Controls<sup type="ref">[33,34]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	RA is itself a risk factor for thromboembolism</li>
<li>	Patients with RA have approximately double the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) as to matched cohorts without RA</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 26 Timecode: 30:17&gt;&gt;
<h3>Baricitinib and VTE: The FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee April 23, 2018, Meeting<sup type="ref">[35]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Recently some concerns have been raised regarding JAK inhibitors and thromboembolic risk</li>
<li>	At an April 2018 meeting of the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee, baricitinib with regard to VTE was discussed</li>
<li>	Data presented on baricitinib indicated an imbalance of VTE in the placebo-controlled period, but that patients had 1 or more VTE risk factors (eg, older age, higher body mass index [BMI], COX-2 inhibitor use compared with matched controls without RA)</li>
<li>	An increased VTE risk not found in patients switched to baricitinib, and there was an absence of a temporal relationship between baricitinib use and VTE</li>
</ul>
&lt;&lt;insert slide 27 Timecode: 31:22&gt;&gt;
<h3> Odds Ratio and Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean Values for Thromboembolic Adverse Events<sup type="ref">[36]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Verden and colleagues assessed postmarket case reports of thromboembolic events possibly associated with JAK inhibitors</li>
<li>	Elevated reporting rates for VTE and PE specifically associated with JAK inhibitors were not found</li>
<li>	However, the FDA&#8217;s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data indicated a potential class-wide issue for JAK inhibitors and pulmonary thrombosis
<ul><li>	This issue needs to be confirmed by subsequent reporting data and/or clinical trials</li></ul></li>
