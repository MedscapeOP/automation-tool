<h3> Potential Predictors of Response to Anti-TNF Treatment<sup type="ref">[11]</sup></h3>

<li>	It is unknown why certain patients achieve different responses</li>

<li>	There are several factors, which have been identified, that can help predict a response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment</li>

<li>	Some differences occur once a patient has achieved a response

<ul><li>	Some patients maintain the response indefinitely

<li>	Others lose response

<ul><li>	Some lose the response gradually, and some seem to lose response quite suddenly </li></ul></li>

<li>	There may be a role for doing an ADA test in these different subsets of patients

<ul><li>	More research is needed to determine the optimal place for ADA testing</li></ul></li></ul></li>
