<h3> Severe Trauma and Uncontrolled Bleeding<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>

<li>	It is important to identify, and then to rapidly and appropriately treat, trauma-associated coagulopathy</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 5&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;Note to EA &#8211; Chapter Title: Goal-Directed Coagulation Management&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:01:56&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Key Decisions in a Goal-Directed Coagulation Management Approach</h3>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 6&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:02:13&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Polling Question 1</h3>

<li>	Which of the following is most frequently abnormal and needs immediate correction in a severely injured patient? </li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 7&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:02:36&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>The Vessel Wall and Platelet-Plug Formation in the Context of Damage<sup type="ref">[2]</sup></h3>

<li>	In the physiologic state, plasma-borne coagulation factors such as platelets and sub-endothelial matrix coagulation factors such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) are nicely separated by the endothelium. As long as the endothelium is intact, there is no coagulation</li>

<li>	However, that changes in the context of endothelial damage
stuff
<ul><li>	The resulting coagulation cascade involves the binding of vWF to collagen, platelet activation, and adherence</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 8&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:04:14&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Excessive Perioperative Bleeding: Role of Fibrin Monomers and Factor XIII<sup type="ref">[3,4]</sup></h3>

<li>	Activated platelets provide a highly efficient surface for activated coagulation factors, enabling the thrombin burst<sup type="ref">[2]</sup></li>

<li>	The thrombin burst, which is sudden and violent, transforms soluble fibrin into fibrinogen, an essential component in the coagulation cascade, responsible for linking activated platelets</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 9&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:05:12&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Fibrinogen and Hemostasis in Massive Bleeding<sup type="ref">[5]</sup></h3>

<li>	Fibrinogen is the coagulation element that is the first to become critically reduced in many trauma situations
stuff
<ul><li>	Accordingly, it is important to realize that, unlike red blood cells (RBCs) or platelets, there are no fibrinogen stores in the body</li></ul></li>

<li>	In ongoing bleeding, when blood is replaced with crystalloids or colloids, hemoglobin eventually stabilizes because RBCs are being mobilized; similarly, platelets stabilize and increase</li>

<li>	However, this is not the case for fibrinogen; and therefore, exogenous fibrinogen needs to be introduced</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 10&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:07:01&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Is FFP Clinically Effective?<sup type="ref">[6]</sup></h3>

<li>	When there is bleeding, many clinicians think of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)</li>

<li>	However, any number of studies going back for decades have questioned the utility of FFP in treating coagulopathy associated with trauma or cardiac surgery</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 11&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:08:24&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Concerns Vis-&Agrave;-Vis FFP<sup> [7-11]</sup></h3>

<li>	Transfusions of FFP are associated with a number of deleterious outcomes</li>

<li>	However, perhaps the main reason not to use FFP is that it is ineffective in the treatment of coagulopathy</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 12&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:09:07&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Considerable Differences Exist Between Clauss-Based Plasma Fibrinogen Measured Using Different Detection Methods<sup type="ref">[12]</sup></h3>

<li>	Lab measurement of fibrinogen Levels can vary widely</li>

<li>	Moreover, valuable time may be lost while awaiting the results from laboratory analyses</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 13&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:09:51&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3>Diagnostics: Viscoelastic Techniques<sup type="ref">[13]</sup></h3>

<li>	Assessment technologies such as thrombelastography (TEG) or rotational thrombelastography (ROTEM) can quickly ascertain coagulation factor Levels and shortfalls</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 14&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:10:39&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Point-Of-Care Coagulation Testing vs Conventional Coagulation Analyses<sup> [14]</sup></h3>

<li>	Weber and colleagues conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing 2 methods of assessing hemostatic therapy efficacy</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 15&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:11:13&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Results: Point-Of-Care Testing in Cardiac Surgery Patients<sup type="ref">[14]</sup></h3>

<li>	Compared with conventional coagulation analyses, point-of-care testing has fewer transfusions of RBCs, fewer FFP transfusions, and a similar number of fibrinogen units per patient. Cost of point-of-care testing was considerably less than conventional coagulation analyses</li>

<li>	Point-of-care coagulation testing group vs the conventional coagulation analyses group had shorter postoperative ventilation times and lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, lower incidence of composite adverse events, and lower mortality during a 6-month follow-up</li>

<li>	Point-of-care coagulation testing also reduced allogenic blood transfusion vs conventional coagulation analyses </li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 16&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:12:06&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>The PROPPR Study: Plasma, Platelets, and RBC Transfusion Ratios<sup> [15]</sup></h3>

<li>	If FFP is ineffective for the treatment of coagulopathy, what about ratios of RBCs, platelets, and plasma</li>

<li>	PROPPR compared 2 transfusion ratios and found them to be similar, and yet it is likely that both ratios are inferior to a goal-directed treatment approach to coagulopathy, where the focus is replenishment of coagulation factors at low Levels in the individual patient</li>
stuff
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 17&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Timecode: 00:13:07&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>The PROPPR Study: Outcomes Results<sup type="ref">[15]</sup></h3>

<li>	No significant differences were observed between the 1:1:1 and the 1:1:2 transfusion ratios in terms of mortality</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [5]; 01:39; Note to EA &#8211; Chapter Title: ADA Development&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3></strong> <strong>Immunogenicity of Biologics in Chronic Inflammatory Diseases<sup type="ref">[6,7]</sup></h3>

<li>	Approximately one-third of patients being treated with biologic therapy do not respond within the first year

<ul><li>	Multiple reasons

<ul><li>	Primary or secondary nonresponses</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li>	The reported rate of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) that develop in patients receiving biologic therapy, either originator compounds or biosimilar compounds, varies greatly</li>

<ul><li>	Differences are due to disparate bioanalytical methods and interpretation approaches, as well as a plethora of product-specific and patient-specific factors that are not fully understood</li>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<li>	The incidence of ADAs cannot be generalized across products </li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [6]; 03:09&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Complex Nature of ADAs<sup type="ref">[7]</sup></h3>

<li>	Traditionally, neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies have been defined as:

<ul><li>	A subset of binding ADAs that bind to the drug and inhibit its pharmacologic function by preventing target binding (neutralizing antibodies)</li>

<li>	ADAs that bind to sites on the drug molecule that do not affect target binding and thereby do not impact the drug&#8217;s pharmacodynamic activity (non-neutralizing)</li></ul></li>

<li>	ADAs represent a very complex set of analytes</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [7]; 03:31&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Neutralizing and Non-Neutralizing Antibodies<sup type="ref">[7]</sup></h3>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [8]; 04:50&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Neutralizing and Non-Neutralizing Antibodies (Cont.)<sup type="ref">[6]</sup></h3>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [9]; 06:09; Note to EA &#8211; Chapter Title: Clinical Relevance of ADAs&gt;</strong>

<h3> Impact of ADAs<sup type="ref">[6]</sup></h3>

<li>	The clinical potential of ADAs is primarily within the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the biologic agent

<ul><li>	A complex between the biologic agent and the drug antibodies is formed, which neutralizes part or all of the drug</li></ul></li>

<li>	What is relevant is that some patients make only a few molecules/antibodies against the therapeutic agent, resulting is a substantial amount of free drug to be available</li>

<li>	In other patients, a large amount of molecules/antibodies are made against the drug complex, resulting in very little effect of the drug; the remaining active concentration may become zero</li>

<li>	However, the bottom line is that if there is sufficient drug concentration to obtain the desired therapeutic effect, then the level of immunogenicity that occurs is not relevant</li>

<li>	Injection site reactions do occur, but they are usually not mediated by ADAs</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [10]; 08:34&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Factors Associated With Immunogenicity<sup type="ref">[6]</sup></h3>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [11]; 10:20&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> MTX Reduces Immunogenicity in a Dose-Dependent Manner<sup type="ref">[8]</sup></h3>

<li>	The dose and timing of methotrexate (MTX) administration affects the rate of formation of ADA</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [12]; 11:55; Note to EA &#8211; Chapter Title: Biologic Agent Monitoring&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Biologic Agent Monitoring in Daily Practice<sup type="ref">[9]</sup></h3>

<li>	It is not necessary to routinely test for ADAs</li>

<li>	Measurement of the serum drug concentration can be helpful

<ul><li>	If the drug level is adequate, then the degree of ADA is not important; it will only lead to confusion</li></ul></li>

<li>	Measuring ADAs may be helpful to better understand why a drug concentration is low or absent

<ul><li>	Many test are available</li>

<li>	If the ADA titer is high, that is a strong indication that immunogenicity is an important issue for the patient</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [13]; 13:00&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Model: ADA Development and Decreased Biologic Serum Concentration<sup type="ref">[10]</sup></h3>

<li>	Most biologic agents have a half-life of approximately 3 weeks</li>

<li>	After drug administration, a maximum concentration (Cmax) is reached</li>

<li>	Important signal for immunogenicity: drug concentration appears to decrease more rapidly than is expected during elimination</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [14]; 13:35&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Biologic Agent Monitoring in Daily Practice<sup type="ref">[9]</sup></h3>

<li>	The serum trough drug concentration should be used to assess therapeutic drug concentrations

<ul><li>	Can be inconvenient to obtain because it may involve patients returning to the clinic for an extra office visit</li></ul></li>

<li>	It is not only ADAs that contribute to drug nonresponse, but also other factors that cannot be easily assessed and quantified</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [15]; 15:15&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Measurement of Biologic Drug Serum Trough Concentration</h3>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [16]; 15:49&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Response to Targeted Treatment in RA<sup type="ref">[11]</sup></h3>

<li>	Some patients achieve complete response, while others achieve partial response or no response  </li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [17]; 16:17&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Potential Predictors of Response to Anti-TNF Treatment<sup type="ref">[11]</sup></h3>

<li>	It is unknown why certain patients achieve different responses</li>

<li>	There are several factors, which have been identified, that can help predict a response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment</li>

<li>	Some differences occur once a patient has achieved a response

<ul><li>	Some patients maintain the response indefinitely</li>

<li>	Others lose response</li>

<li>	Some lose the response gradually, and some seem to lose response quite suddenly 

<li>	There may be a role for doing an ADA test in these different subsets of patients

<ul><li>	More research is needed to determine the optimal place for ADA testing</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [18]; 17:35&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Considerations for Patients With Loss of Response to Biologic Therapy</h3>

<li>	There is still a great deal to discuss regarding how best to use ADA testing</li>

<li>	While it is not practical or cost-efficient to test all patients, ADA testing can provide information in certain patient populations, including patients who are not responding to treatment with a biologic agent</li>

<ul><li>	If the patient has no/low drug concentration, measure ADAs

<li>	If a high ADA titer is found, the drug is likely being cleared because of immunogenicity

<ul><li>	The drug mechanism is not failing, but the specific drug is failing; can switch from 1 anti-TNF agent to another</li></ul></li>

<li>	If the patient&#8217;s drug concentration is at a good level, then consider that the target is blocked (drug mechanism is failing)

<ul><li>	Switch to a drug with a different mechanism of action</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li>	If the patient is responding well, but a low drug concentration is present, there are 2 explanations</li>

<ul><li>	The patient is doing well and not taking his or her drugs </li>

<li>	The patient is doing well despite making ADAs and clearing the drug</li></ul></li>

<li>	In this case, there is no benefit to continuing the drug 

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [19]; 19:29&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Reduction of Overexposure in Patients With RA and High Serum ADA Concentrations<sup type="ref">[12]</sup></h3>

<li>	A recent publication found that adalimumab-treated patients with RA with trough concentrations &gt; 8&#8201;&#181;g/mL can prolong their standard dosing interval to once every 3&#8201;weeks without loss of disease control</li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [20]; 20:07&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> RA Treatment Based on Antibody Responses?</h3>

<li>	Currently, specific dosing regimens of the individual biologic agents are licensed for use</li>

<li>	This one-size-fits-all dosing is in contrast with individualized/tailored dosing according to the patient&#8217;s needs</li>

<li>	Having a single dose available for all patients is pragmatic; it is the only way to do a randomized controlled trial (RCT)</li>

<li>	However, it is the drug concentration that elicits an effect

<ul><li>	If there is a large variation in the drug concentrations of biologic agents (originator or biosimilar), then one may consider that dosing based on drug concentration might be a better strategy

<ul><li>	Treatment could be personalized</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li>	Personalized dosing is a good topic for research, but should not be used at this time</li>

<ul><li>	At present, it is difficult to endorse treatment based on antibody responses</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [21]; 21:51&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Serum Drug Levels of Biologic Agents in the Management of RA: A Systematic Review<sup type="ref">[13]</sup></h3>

<li>	Data demonstrating thata particular concentration correlates to the particular response is lacking

<ul><li>	Particularly in a situation where we know that patients have quite variable immune systems </li>

<li>	Data from the original dose-finding studies of the various biologic agents is needed</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [22]; 23:05&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Potential Predictors of Response to Anti-TNF Treatment<sup type="ref">[11]</sup></h3>

<li>	Several factors help predict response to anti-TNF therapy

<ul><li>	Concomitant use of MTX</li>

<li>	Patients on monotherapy, without using combination therapy with MTX, are at increased risk of developing neutralizing antibodies

<li>	Patients with a higher body mass index require more bioavailability of the drug; they may need more drug to have an effect

<ul><li>	May never develop ADAs</li>

<li>	Probably more relevant for drug levels</li></ul></li>

<li>	Patients with impaired renal function are more likely to retain the drug, leading to higher drug levels</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [23]; 24:55&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> EULAR Recommendations for the Management of RA With csDMARDs and bDMARDs<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>

<li>	Concomitant use of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), in particular, MTX, is important to produce the best response

<ul><li>	MTX has an additive effect on efficacy in patients with RA

<ul><li>	MTX also helps prevent formation of ADA</li></ul></li>

<li>	 The data are less clear regarding the beneficial effects of concomitant MTX in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [24]; 25:30&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> MTX Use in Patients With PsA or axSpA</h3>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [25]; 27:40; Note to EA &#8211; Chapter Title: Use of Biosimilars in Clinical Practice&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Biosimilars and Their Reference Agents Are Interchangeable<sup type="ref">[14,15]</sup></h3>

<li>	Biosimilar agents offer cost savings and health gains for patients with chronic rheumatic diseases such as RA

<ul><li>	Some physicians are cautious about the application in the real world</li></ul></li>

<li>	Clinicians can be more confident now using biosimilars

<ul><li>	Have several years of real-world data </li></ul></li>

<li>	There are no meaningful differences in the efficacy or the safety between originator compounds and biosimilar drugs </li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [26]; 28:10&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> The Data Requirements for Biosimilar Approval Are Comprehensive<sup type="ref">[16]</sup></h3>

<li>	To qualify as a biosimilar, efficacy must be proven in a particular indication, and then the biosimilar would achieve the licensing indication across what the originators had originally achieved </li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [27]; 28:27&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> NOR-SWITCH: Switching From Originator Infliximab to Biosimilar CT-P13<sup type="ref">[17]</sup></h3>

<li>	Upon review of real-world data, such as NOR-SWITCH, there are no meaningful differences in terms of efficacy when switching from an originator to the biosimilar</li>

<li>	Interestingly, at a recent European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) meeting, there was a report of patients who switched from the originator etanercept to the biosimilar etanercept, and then roughly 15% to 17% switched back to the originator etanercept

<ul><li>	There were no definitive reasons for the switch back</li>

<li>	The authors concluded that there were several subjective reasons why the patients switched back, suggesting that there could have been a nocebo effect on the part of the patients and maybe even some subconscious influence from the physicians

<ul><li>	The switch back to originator etanercept is unlikely to be due to an immunogenicity-related lack of efficacy </li></ul></li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [28]; 29:54&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> RCTs of Switching From Originator Infliximab to Biosimilar Infliximab in RA<sup type="ref">[18,19]</sup></h3>

<li>	Rates of immunogenicity were similar in the original infliximab biosimilar studies, PLANET-RA and PLANET-AS</li>

<ul><li>	This makes sense from an immunologic standpoint and understanding of what the biosimilar concept is all about; that the it is an identical protein with variations that are not related to immunogenicity</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [29]; 31:04&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Recommendations Regarding the Use of Biosimilars in Patients With RA<sup type="ref">[1,20]</sup></h3>

<li>	Mark Lazarus, PhD, MRCP: We have been switching patients to the biosimilars in our practice; we are comfortable with switching and have seen very good results

<ul><li>	I have not observed any major complications from switching</li></ul></li>

<li>	The EULAR guidelines for the treatment of patients with RA state that biosimilars should be used in agreement with the patient

<ul><li>	However, once the physician and patient have agreed to use a biosimilar, it is basically the very similar molecule/effect</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [30]; 32:18&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Use of Biosimilars: Discussion Points With Patients<sup type="ref">[16]</sup></h3>

<li>	In general, patients are happy with the switch from biologic to biosimilar

<ul><li>	Can switch back if efficacy is lost; have reassurance</li>

<li>	Very few patients refuse to change</li></ul></li>

<li>	Gertjan Wolbink, MD: in our institute, if EMA- or FDA-approved biosimilar agents are available, we use the biosimilar drug, which is generally lower in cost

<ul><li>	If an originator biologic agent is lower in cost, we would use that agent as well</li></ul></li>

<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [31]; 33:36&gt;&gt;</strong>

<h3> Biosimilar Switching: Evidence From Arthritis Studies<sup type="ref">[14,17,21,22]</sup></h3>

<li>	Based on studies, such asNOR-SWITCH and others, the efficacy and safety of biosimilar agents for the treatment of patients with RA has been established</li>

<li>	Not all patients receiving originator biologic will achieve 100% response over a year

<ul><li>	It is the same for the biosimilar drugs; not all patients will achieve 100% response 

<li>	Anticipate

<ul><li>	Discuss this fact with patients</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li>	Hector Chinoy, PhD, FRCP: I agree with the EULAR guidelines for the treatment of patients with RA</li>

<ul><li>	I think that it is very important to keep the patient involved with the decision-making process

<li>	Biosimilar agents are not just the cheapest drug; they offer the best value package 

<ul><li>	Patients may have a preference regarding drug delivery device; there are subtle differences between the originator and the biosimilar</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li>	Biosimilar agents can be used in several diseases, including PsA and axSpA</li>
