&lt;&lt;insert slide 3; Chapter Title: <strong>Overview</strong>; 00:54 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> EoE Overview<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>

<li>	Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergy-mediated condition caused by an excess of eosinophils in the esophagus</li>

<li>	Although EoE symptoms overlap with gastroesophageal reflux disease, they are 2 very different conditions</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 4; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 01:52 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Epidemiology of EoE<sup type="ref">[2,3]</sup></h3>

<li>	EoE has a genetic preponderance in white males; it is seen about twice as often in males as in females</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 5; Chapter Title: <strong>Symptoms and Diagnosis</strong>; 02:48 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Symptoms of EoE: Children<sup type="ref">[4,5]</sup></h3>

<li>	EoE symptoms in children are often nonspecific</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 6; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 03:18 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Clinical Symptoms of EoE: Adolescents and Adults<sup type="ref">[5,6]</sup></h3>

<li>	In adults, the primary EoE symptom is dysphagia, or trouble swallowing</li>

<li>	Some patients will avoid hard foods like crusty bread and will eat mainly soft foods</li>

<li>	Heartburn and chest pain are common EoE symptoms in adults</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 7; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 04:16 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Diagnosis of EoE Is Challenging<sup type="ref">[4,5,7]</sup></h3>

<li>	Just having eosinophils in the esophagus is not enough to make a diagnosis of EoE because this can be caused by other conditions </li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 8; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 05:28 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Endoscopic Findings</h3>

<li>	Endoscopic findings in EoE can range from mild and subtle to very severe cases in which the entire esophagus becomes narrow and stiff like a drinking straw</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 9; Chapter Title: <strong>Do PPIs Help With Diagnosis?</strong>; 06:30 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> The PPI Diagnostic Dilemma<sup type="ref">[1,5,8]</sup></h3>

<li>	In recent years, data have shown that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) responsive EoE and EoE have very similar endoscopic and clinical findings</li>

<li>	The aggregate of the data on PPIs and EoE indicates that PPIs are better used as a treatment for EoE than as a diagnostic tool

<ul><li>	International guidelines have removed PPI response as a diagnostic criteria for EoE</li></ul></li>

<h3> The PPI Diagnostic Dilemma (cont)</h3>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 11; Chapter Title: <strong>Treatment Overview</strong>; 09:34 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Treatment Goals<sup type="ref">[9]</sup></h3>

<li>	<strong>Jonathan M. Spergel, MD, PhD:</strong> One of the biggest issues with EoE is that histologic response -- reduction in eosinophils in the esophagus -- often does not correlate well with symptom relief</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 12; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 10:42 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Treatment Options for EoE<sup type="ref">[5,9]</sup></h3>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 13; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 11:33 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> PPI Therapy<sup type="ref">[10,11]</sup></h3>

<li>	PPI therapy for EoE should be high dose: 20 mg to 40 mg twice daily or equivalent in adults, and 1 to 2 mg/kg or equivalent in children</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 14; Chapter Title: <strong>Steroids;</strong> 12:30 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Steroids for EoE: Overview<sup type="ref">[9,11]</sup></h3>

<li>	Topical steroids are the mainstay of therapy for EoE; they are highly effective in eliminating eosinophils and improving symptoms</li>

<li>	Most clinicians will start with an 8- to 12-week course of topical steroids and re-evaluate the patient after 6 to 12 weeks</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 15; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 14:13 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Swallowed Topical Steroids<sup type="ref">[2,5]</sup></h3>

<li>	It is essential to dose steroids properly in patients with EoE</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 16; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 15:33 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Optimal Delivery of Topical Steroids<sup type="ref">[9]</sup></h3>

<li>	Patients should receive specific instructions for both the preparation of the steroid and how to use it</li>

<li>	There are many different ways to mix a swallowed steroid preparation; much of it comes down to patient preference</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 17; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 16:32 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Budesonide: Nebulized vs Viscous Oral Formulations<sup type="ref">[12]</sup></h3>

<li>	The better the steroid formulation coats the esophagus, the better the patient's response will be</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 18; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 16:57 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Budesonide Oral Suspension: Phase 2 Trial<sup type="ref">[13]</sup></h3>

<li>	In this phase 2 study of a novel budesonide oral suspension (BOS), symptoms measured by a standardized dysphagia symptom questionnaire were significantly improved in the BOS arm compared with placebo</li>

<li>	Histologic response rates and endoscopic severity were also substantially improved in the BOS treatment arm</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 19; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 18:18 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Budesonide Orodispersible Tablet: Phase 3 Trial<sup type="ref">[14]</sup></h3>

<li>	A phase 3 trial done in Europe evaluated an dissolvable budesonide tablet for treatment of EoE</li>

<li>	Whereas the BOS study was 12 weeks, this was a 6-week treatment course</li>

<li>	No patients in the placebo arm had combined clinical-histologic remission vs 58% in the active treatment arm </li>

<h3> Fluticasone Dissolvable Tablet: Phase 1/2A Study<sup type="ref">[15]</sup></h3>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 21; Chapter Title: <strong>Diet Therapy</strong>; 19:51 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Elemental Diet<sup type="ref">[5,11,16]</sup></h3>

<li>	The elemental diet is usually a last resort for EoE because the diet is so poorly tolerated</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 22; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 20:47 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Elimination and Allergy-Directed Diets<sup type="ref">[16-19]</sup></h3>

<li>	The efficacy of food elimination diets varies depending on the patient population and which foods are eliminated

<ul><li>	The 6-food elimination diet is approximately 50% to 70% effective</li></ul></li>

<li>	Food elimination diets have generally replaced allergy-directed diets for EoE because they are less complicated and just as effective</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 23; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 22:20 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Step-Up/Step-Down Elimination Diets<sup type="ref">[18,20]</sup></h3>

<li>	Step-up or step-down diets either add or eliminate potential food triggers one at a time</li>

<li>	In most patients with EoE, milk is the number one trigger followed by eggs and wheat</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 24; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 22:59 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Elimination Diets: Patient Education</h3>

<li>	<strong>Dr Spergel: </strong>What I find most effective in my practice is to emphasize what patients can eat rather than what they cannot eat

<ul><li>	It is also very important to work with dieticians to help patients comply with diets and make sure patients are getting the proper nutrients</li></ul></li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 25; Chapter Title: <strong>Biologics Under Investigation;</strong> 24:00 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> IL-5 Inhibitors<sup type="ref">[21-24]</sup></h3>

<li>	Clinical studies of interleukin (IL) 5 inhibitors in EoE showed some efficacy in reducing eosinophilia, but not for improving symptoms</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 26; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 24:55 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Dupilumab: Phase 2 Study<sup type="ref">[25]</sup></h3>

<li>	In a phase 2 study of dupilumab, an anti-IL-4/IL-13 antibody, for EoE in adults, there were significant improvements in symptoms of dysphagia and in secondary endpoints vs placebo</li>

<li>	This agent appears to show promise for treatment of EoE</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 27; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 25:57 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Anti-IL-13 RPC4046: Phase 2 Study<sup type="ref">[26]</sup></h3>

<li>	RPC4046 is another novel anti-IL-13 agent that has shown promise for EoE treatment</li>

<li>	In a phase 2 study, patients who received this agent had significant improvement of EoE symptoms and endoscopic features compared with placebo</li>

<li>	Symptoms improved significantly in the steroid-refractory population, which was of interest</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 28; Chapter Title: <strong>Dilation Therapy</strong>; 27:08 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Endoscopic Dilation Therapy<sup type="ref">[5,27,28]</sup></h3>

<li>	Dilation therapy is a purely mechanical treatment for EoE; the dilator is breaking up the scar tissue and fibrosis that has formed</li>

<li>	It does not affect the underlying pathophysiology of the disease</li>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 29; Chapter Title: Click or tap here to enter text.; 28:06 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Endoscopic Dilation Therapy (cont)<sup type="ref">[27-29]</sup></h3>

<li>	The main side effect of dilation therapy is chest pain, which can last for several days and can be moderate to severe</li>

<li>	It is important to explain to patients that chest pain after the procedure is expected and does not mean something has gone wrong</li>

<h3> Endoscopic Dilation: Images<sup type="ref">[28]</sup></h3>

&lt;&lt;insert slide 31; Chapter Title: <strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>; 30:59 &gt;&gt; 

<h3> Concluding Remarks</h3>

<li>	It is critical to get the correct diagnosis in EoE; this means having the full clinical and histologic picture and ruling out conditions that can mimic EoE</li>

<li>	Dilation has an important role in treating strictures and keeping the esophagus open</li>

<li>	If patients are not responding, make sure they are taking their medication correctly and/or implementing their diets correctly</li>

<li>	There are many new therapies for EoE on the horizon, including new formulations of topical therapies and biologics</li>
