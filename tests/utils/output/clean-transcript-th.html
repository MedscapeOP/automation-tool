<p><strong>Kris V. Kowdley, MD:</strong>	Good evening. On behalf of the other speakers joining us, it's a pleasure for me to invite you to this Medscape Live event, NASH: The Epidemic Is Here, Are You Ready? I'm Kris Kowdley, the director of the Liver Care Network and Organ Care Research at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, Washington. With me are Dr Zobair Younossi and Dr Mitchell Shiffman.</p>

<p>	In this program, Dr Younossi, who is extremely well published in this area from the standpoint of the global epidemiology of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and patient-reported outcomes and health economic outcomes in NASH, will give a talk on the global epidemic of NASH from a 30,000-foot view. Then Dr Shiffman is going to walk us through cases and identify patients with advanced fibrosis in NASH, which is very important because that is the direction that we seem to be headed with regard to identifying novel therapies and evaluating disease response in treatment studies. I will conclude with a discussion of emerging therapies from mechanism of action to efficacy and safety. We'll have some concluding remarks and, we hope, have an opportunity not only for us to interact with each other but also for audience questions and answers.</p>

<p>	With that, it's a pleasure for me to introduce Zobair, professor and chairman at the Center for Liver Disease, Department of Medicine, Inova Fairfax Medical Campus, the Betty and Guy Beatty Center for Integrated Research Inova in Falls Church, Virginia, to take us through the global epidemiology of NASH from a high level. </p>

<p><strong>Zobair M. Younossi, MD:</strong>	Thank you very much, Kris, and thanks for all of you to take this time to have dinner with us and listen to some information, maybe some new information, about nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). I will give you a little information about what is going on in terms of the prevalence and then progressiveness of NASH and then some other outcomes that are important from patient perspective and from in situ perspective.</p>

<p>	The global epidemic of NAFLD, the global prevalence. is about 25%. It seems that this disease is more common in men, and it increases with age. Probably the highest prevalence is in individuals about 55 to 60 years old. When you're looking for the prevalence of NASH in the general population, you cannot obtain a biopsy specimen from everyone in the general population, so you have to estimate that. That estimate is somewhere between 1.5% and 6.5%. These numbers are from a meta-analysis that we performed a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>	The prevalence is highest in the Middle East and lowest in Africa. In the Middle East, certain areas have even higher prevalence rates. In United Arab Emirates and in Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of NAFLD is about 25%. In Turkey, the prevalence of NAFLD is about 48%. An area that has the fastest growing rate of obesity is Mexico, where the prevalence of NAFLD is probably one of the highest. Some of the lowest rates in the Americas are in Peru and Chile, where the prevalence rate is probably about 10% to 15%.</p>

<p>	One of the most important issues is that prevalence is also high in children. The overall prevalence of NAFLD in kids is about 10%, although the reports suggest a rate as high as 17%. When you look at some autopsy series, the prevalence of NAFLD is higher in Hispanic boys. And when they become a bit older, the prevalence goes up. This rate is consistent with the fact that the prevalence of NAFLD is higher in American Hispanics. Of course, it's a common disease so the question is, so what? Does it progress or not? There are plenty of data to suggest that a subtype of NAFLD will progress.</p>

<p>	When you look at this cartoon of progressiveness of the spectrum of NAFLD, you have basically the majority of patients who have fatty liver and who will not have the progressive subtype, which is called NASH -- about 75% of patients will have non-NASH NAFLD. Those patients in general do not progress in terms of liver disease. However, they're at increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Cardiovascular mortality is the number one cause of death in these patients.</p>

<p>	When you look at the NASH subgroup of NAFLD, those are the patients who can develop cirrhosis, probably over a 10- to 20-year period. There are fast progressors, there are slow progressors. In fact, there is progression and regression of fibrosis in these patients, and this is part of the complexity of this disease. Once you develop cirrhosis, of course, you're at risk for complications of cirrhosis and that includes not only liver failure but also liver cancer.</p>

<p>	The other peculiar issue about this disease is that although most of the patients with cancer in the setting of NAFLD will have cirrhosis, that's not always the case. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the cirrhotic patient is about 2% to 3% per year. When you look at NAFLD without cirrhosis, the incidence is about 0.5% per year. Why is that important? It's important, first, because in your practice, you will see patients who may not have cirrhosis but who do have fatty liver disease and do have liver cancer. Second, the rate is low enough that you cannot perform population-based screening of all these patients. However, if you have patients with cirrhosis with NASH, then you have to screen these patients like everyone else.</p>

<p>	What is some of the evidence that suggests this progressiveness? First, results from a cohort study from a tertiary care center showed that when you group patients with NAFLD in terms of whether they do or do not have NASH, the patients with NASH have a higher mortality rate over a 15-year period. Survival rates are lower in patients with multiple components of metabolic syndrome. We published this information a couple of years ago looking at an enhanced database, and the more components of metabolic syndrome you have, the higher is the liver-related mortality.</p>

<p>	Steatofibrosis is also an important predictor of mortality. A meta-analysis of multiple studies, including ours, from different parts of the world looked at the stage of fibrosis in mortality. Both liver-related mortality and overall mortality increase at about stage 2 or higher. Stage 2 or higher suggests that these patients are at risk for adverse events.</p>

<p>	As I mentioned, liver cancer is one of the complications of NASH-related cirrhosis. The SEER data, which is kept by the National Council Institute, suggest that the rate of NASH-related disease is increasing. In fact, patients with NASH-related HCC may have a poorer prognosis because by the time they come to see you, they have larger tumors. They may not be a candidate for resection or transplantation, so that's another issue with these patients.</p>

<p>	There is other evidence for the progressiveness of this disease. If you look at the chart over here, that basically is the United Network for Organ Sharing database for transplantation. It's a couple of years old, actually. When you look at this, the blue line shows you that the indication for liver transplantation related to hepatitis C is now declining. Both NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease or alcoholic liver disease are now becoming the top indications for liver transplantation.</p>

<p>	This other graph on my right, your left, at the top shows that when you look at HCC candidates for liver transplantation, NASH-related HCC is the fastest growing indication for HCC-related transplantation. Finally, this bottom graph suggests that when you look over time, you see that the number of patients who are on the transplant list with cryptogenic cirrhosis is coming down and the number of patients with NASH is going up. That may be because those patients always have NASH-related cirrhosis and they were on the transplantation waitlist, but there is now increasing recognition of the fact that cryptogenic cirrhosis is NASH. That may be part of it. The other part, of course, is that NASH prevalence and complication are increasing.</p>

<p>	Which of the following is the main driver of the epidemic of obesity or the epidemic of NAFLD -- obesity tied to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or genetic predisposition? Obesity is number one and diabetes is number two. There is suggestion for genetic predisposition, but that probably explains a smaller proportion of this increase. Obesity is the root of the problem.</p>

<p>	When you look worldwide, in 2016, about 2 billion people were obese or overweight. More than 650 million people worldwide were obese; about 350 million children were obese. If you look at every country, every region of the world, these rates for obesity or overweight are going up. It's common, and it's becoming more of a problem; the rate of obesity has tripled since the mid-1970s.</p>

<p>	What are the consequences of this? I have already talked to you about some of the data that are relatively old. These are completely new data; they will be presented next month. The first graph to my left, to your right, is the enhanced data set for 1988 to 2016 that we looked at. About 58,000 to 59,000 individuals with chronic liver disease were included. The bottom line of this study was that when you look at the top line, that's NAFLD over time. You see that NAFLD is increasing. When you look at hepatitis C virus infection, it's decreasing. </p>

<p>	The other graph looks at mortality data from death certificates -- again, the same thing. You can see that NAFLD is increasing in terms of cause of liver-related mortality. Hepatitis C virus infection is decreasing probably not only because of identification of some of these patients but also because of the very effective treatment that we have. There are consequences related to the obesity epidemic in the world, at least in terms of liver disease.</p>

<p>	Another polling question. In the United States, NASH is the fastest growing cause of cirrhosis, HCC, liver transplant, liver-related mortality, or all of these? It's quite true that NASH is probably becoming the number one or number two indication for liver transplantation right now. We're looking at the data for 2018 and 2019 now, and it seems like that's basically the trend.</p>

<p>	Another way to look at the future mortality burden of NASH is to perform modeling or use markup modeling in this analysis. This is a study that used the markup modeling in which a few of us were involved. Basically, it suggested that between 2015 and 2030, the rate of bridging fibrosis related to NASH or cirrhosis related to NASH will double. This is going to lead to about 800,000 additional deaths in 2030 related to NASH. This is not only in the United States. The same models apply to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, and you see almost the same trends in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>	I'm going to spend just a minute on the pathogenesis of this disease. Remember, NASH is not a single disease; it's a phenotype. There are multiple pathways that will get you to the phenotype of NASH. The first culprit, of course, is fat accumulation. You need to have about 5% fat accumulation or more to have fatty liver. But then you have a number of mechanisms that can give you the second, third, and fourth hits. Lipotoxicity of course is one, but you can have oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and other insults such as dysbiosis that can cause more damage to the liver and cause inflammation, ballooning, and ultimately activation of stellate cells and fibrosis.</p>

<p>	The last 2 slides discuss other types of outcomes that are important. It's not only that clinical outcomes, cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and liver cancer are common in these patients. These patients also have impairment of their patient-reported outcome or quality of life. Here are the baseline data for the STELLAR 3 and 4 studies, which is basically a large study of 1 of the drugs that Kris is going to talk about. There are patients with stage 3 and 4 fibrosis and NASH.</p>

<p>	You can see in this 1 domain of NASH that patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis have significant impairment of their quality of life. Why is that important? It's important because most clinicians believe that NASH is asymptomatic. In fact, when you assess the quality of life of these patients with a validated instrument, you see that they're impaired more than the general population. In fact, in the study I presented at the Asia Pacific Association for the Study of Liver Disease comparing hepatitis C virus infection with NASH, hepatitis C has more mental health patient-reported outcome impairment and NASH has more physical health patient-reported outcome impairment. There is quite a bit of impairment here.</p>

<p>	Finally, the economic burden. That's an important part of the outcome; when you look at value or at how you practice value-based medicine, it's clinical outcome, quality outcome, and cost outcome. This is a markup model we did a few years ago to look at the burden of NASH-related fibrosis. As you can see, when you look at those patients who have significant fibrosis with NASH, their cost to society is projected to be in hundreds of billions of dollars. It's an expensive disease.</p>

<p>	The last point is that this is a disease that also is associated with a number of extrahepatic manifestations. Of course, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and cardiovascular disease are already known to you. But a piece of information that's relatively new concerns the non-HCC type of malignancies. There was a study that was presented last year looking at non&#8211;HCC-related malignancies, and, in fact, rates of gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer are higher in patients with NAFLD.</p>

<p>	To summarize the global burden, NASH has a high prevalence worldwide and that prevalence is growing. NASH is responsible for not only adverse clinical outcome but also economic outcome and patient-reported outcome. In that context, early identification and management of NASH, especially NASH with significant fibrosis, will be very important. That's what Dr Shiffman will talk about. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Kowdley:</strong>	Zobair, I'm going to ask you 1 question, and then I'll introduce Mitch for the next part of the talk. Does obesity-associated NAFLD have a different outcome than non&#8211;obesity-associated NAFLD? Along with that, is there a mechanism for why Asian patients may develop NAFLD at much lower rates of body mass index?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Younossi:</strong>	When you look at the "lean" NAFLD in the United States and look at the enhanced database, the prevalence is about 7%. But when you look at these patients and compare them with lean control subjects, they have more insulin resistance, their fibrosis scores are higher, and diabetes is more prevalent. They are not completely metabolically normal. If you look at the same enhanced database, and you look at lean patients with NAFLD, with fatty liver on ultrasound, without any metabolic syndrome, that prevalence is about 0.2%. Metabolically, they are completely normal patients with fatty liver disease, and the prevalence is very, very low. Those patients don't develop bad liver disease.</p>

<p>When you look at the lean patients with NAFLD in Asia, the majority of them have some degree of insulin resistance. In Asia, there is a gradation. If you go to urban areas, they all look like us. Basically, they are obese, they have metabolic syndrome, they have diabetes. When you look at the rural areas, they are leaner with NAFLD. In that context, maybe dysbiosis related to the environment is playing a greater role in some of the rural areas of India and perhaps China. The pathogenesis may be different in Asia and some of the areas, but most patients with a body mass index (BMI) that does not make the cutoff for obese or overweight still has some degree of insulin resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Kowdley:</strong>	It sounds like insulin resistance is the common pathway and it may be the metabolic profile that's more important than just a single number like BMI.</p>

<p>Dr Kowdley:	Great, thank you very much. The next part of this meeting is going to be a very important one because it concerns how we pick those patients who are at greater risk for disease progression or at greater risk for more advanced disease among the huge proportion of patients who have NAFLD? To walk us through that, Mitch Shiffman is going to help us identify which patients have advanced fibrosis in the setting of NASH and then focus on a case-based discussion, because that will make it much more relevant to us. Mitch is director of Bon Secours Liver Institute of Richmond, Virginia, and Hampton Roads and Newport News. He has published in just about every area of hepatology, and I really look forward to this talk. Thank you, Mitch.</p>

<p><strong>Mitchell L. Shiffman, MD:</strong>	Thanks very much, Chris. It's a pleasure to be with you all this evening. What we're going to do is look at the phenotype of patients with NASH based on some of the principles that Dr Younossi has already laid out and then work through some cases given our current therapies for NASH, although limited, where they can be best applied to certain patient groups.</p>

<p>	Who has advanced NASH? If you look at your clinic population, your office population, when you see patients come in -- who do you think may have NASH and in which patients do you want to explore this diagnosis? Clearly, the number one comorbidity as we've already alluded to is type 2 diabetes in the setting of obesity, dyslipidemia, and the overall metabolic syndrome. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are also at increased risk to have NASH. Recommendations by the 2 major societies in the world for liver disease, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (ASSLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), clearly suggest that you should suspect that your patient has fatty liver disease, either NAFLD or NASH, in patients with type 2 diabetes and in those with significant cardiovascular disease along with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.</p>

<p>	Metabolic syndrome is made up of a composite of several abnormalities, which include abdominal obesity, a waistline greater than 35 in, or 89 cm, for those of you outside the United States, in women and greater than 40 in, or 102 cm, in men. Dyslipidemia, elevated triglycerides greater than 150, a serum HDL less 40 in men or less than 50 in women, and critically important, elevated fasting glucose (a measure of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes), and elevated fasting blood sugar greater than 100. Finally, the last component of metabolic syndrome is hypertension.</p>

<p>	The more of these features that a patient has, the higher is the likelihood your patient has NASH rather than benign or nonalcoholic fatty liver; Zobair pointed out the 2 groups. The nonprogressive of nonalcoholic fatty liver compares with the progressive of NASH. For me, when I see a patient in the office who has elevated liver enzymes and type 2 diabetes, that patient has a high likelihood of NASH along with all of the features of metabolic syndrome. There are other factors that increase the likelihood of NASH. We've already touched on some of these.</p>

<p>	There are genetics. There is a gene that's been isolated that is strongly associated with NASH. Environmental effects -- where you live, your diet -- and the role of the microbiome are other factors. This is clearly the decade of the microbiome. It's been implicated in many different gastrointestinal diseases, and I'm sure there are many symposia here as well many presentations on the role of gut bacteria on different disease states and gastrointestinal diseases. There's also lots of data on disordered microbiome and its impact on fatty liver and contribution to NASH.</p>

<p>	NASH is present in lots of different clinic presentations. We see that in our patients referred to hepatologists or gastroenterologists because the primary care or another subspecialist has already recognized the phenotype of metabolic syndrome and now referred the patient to you. However, you can find NASH in other clinical situations, and our colleagues need to be aware of this. This particular study was designed to compare the prevalence of NASH in 2 different clinic situations: gastroenterology/hepatology clinics and endocrinology clinics. It looked at the clinical characteristics of patients from endocrinology clinics (271 patients) or from gastroenterology/hepatology clinics (361 patients). The study was primarily performed in Austin and San Antonio, Texas.</p>

<p>	NASH was identified in patients if they had a FibroScan&reg;value greater than 8.5 kPa with a controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score of greater than 270 or a NASH fibrosis score of greater than 0.67 or a FibroScan&reg; score of greater than 10 with a CAP of greater than 270 with a NASH fibrosis score between 1.45 and 0.67 or if the patient has had biopsy-confirmed NASH. You could identify patients with NASH based on these criteria. Basically, gastroenterology/hepatology clinic patients had a much higher prevalence of NASH than patients in endocrinology clinics, although the patients in the endocrinology clinics had more risk factors.</p>

<p>	Our interpretation of this particular study is that patients in the endocrinology clinic have all these risk factors for NASH but they're not being referred on because they haven't yet presented with abnormal liver enzymes or with more severe features of NASH. Perhaps early referral of these patients could identify NASH at an earlier point.</p>

<p>	Moving onto therapeutic approaches for both NAFLD and NASH, we can look at several different buckets of therapy. One is weight loss. We know weight loss helps this disease, and if you lose about 20% of your body weight, virtually all steatosis will be gone; there are several studies that confirm that. You want to treat diabetes and get that glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) down into the normal range. You want to make lifestyle changes, not just diet but exercise as well, because these have profound effects on NASH and help NASH resolve. Finally, there are medications that are currently available for treatment although we look forward to the future; Kris will talk about some of the very, very promising drugs that are in the pipeline.</p>

<p>	Zobair showed you this slide. This is a multi-hit disease. You need to have steatosis within hepatocytes, but once you have that, there are several other factors that can contribute to the patient developing NASH from their fatty hepatocytes. These factors include cytokines, dysbiosis or cytokines released from abnormal gut bacteria, inflammatory markers within the liver, and, clearly, oxidative stress. With that, we're going to now go through 4 cases; each patient, or case, represents a slightly different phenotype of NASH. We're going to discuss what may be the best therapy for each of these different patients.</p>

<p>	Our first case is a 42-year-old man whose BMI is 32. He has a fasting blood glucose of 90, which is normal. He's got some nonspecific right upper quadrant pain, which led to an ultrasound showing fatty liver. His liver enzymes are normal. What would you do next for this particular patient who has an ultrasound suggesting fatty liver but normal liver enzymes and no evidence of diabetes? No further workup, a predictive model looking at different fibrosis markers of NASH, a FibroScan&reg;, or a biopsy?</p>

<p>	Many of you picked a couple of different things that you can do based on what you have available. But, clearly, all of you have pointed out that you want an assessment of the severity of NASH and fibrosis severity in this patient. You can do so with FibroScan&reg; or, if you don't have FibroScan&reg; available to you, a predictive model of fibrosis such as fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). Both are excellent choices depending on what you have available in your office or close by.</p>

<p>	There are various noninvasive strategies to confirming NASH. Basically, when we see a patient with an abnormal ultrasound suggesting NASH, I, too, do exactly the same thing. I want to know if the patient has have significant fibrosis, which means to me the phenotype of NASH, or does the patient have minimal or no fibrosis, which means the patient probably has NAFLD and may have a very good outcome. I would approach those 2 types of patients very differently, as I'm sure you do as well.</p>

<p>	One of the ways we can do this is with elastography; elastography measures liver stiffness. There are basically 3 elastography modalities to measure liver stiffness. One is FibroScan&reg;, which is vibration-controlled transient elastography. Many of you may have that capability in your office or clinic. It can be used as a point of care. We use FibroScan&reg; on patients with suspected fatty liver disease to see if they have increased fibrosis. Two-dimensional shear wave elastography is also available in the United States and many other countries. This is basically an ultrasound unit that has a shear wave elastography module. We have a FibroScan&reg; in one of our offices and an ultrasound elastography unit in the other. The values that you get from these are not exactly the same as you go up the scale of fibrosis, but they are fairly comparable -- higher numbers are bad, lower numbers are good.</p>

<p>	Finally, magnetic resonance elastography is thought to be the most accurate modality to measure liver stiffness. However, it's done in a magnetic resonance machine, which can be slightly claustrophobic for many of our patients, particularly those who are very obese, and, at least in the United States, it is cost prohibitive at this point, although that may be improved now that a specific <em>International Classification of Diseases</em>-10 code has been established for magnetic resonance elastography.</p>

<p>	This is a photograph of a FibroScan&reg; measuring an individual who is fairly lean for NASH but may have the lean phenotype for NASH. You can see that his CAP score, in blue, is 275, which is on the borderline between fatty liver and no fatty liver. His liver stiffness score is 7.7, which correlates with about stage 1 borderline, stage 2 fibrosis. This patient basically has a mild form of fatty liver disease as suggested by ultrasound and with a borderline CAP value.</p>

<p>	What would your recommendation be for this patient? Lifestyle management, controlled diabetes (remember his blood glucose is normal), antioxidant therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, or antifibrotic therapy? The vast majority of you suggest lifestyle management, which I completely agree with. Kris, any comments on this?</p>

<p>Dr Kowdley:	There is no right answer, but the patient obviously doesn't have diabetes. The kPa score was only 4 (the example was 7.7), but this patient does not have diabetes or hypertension, and he has a BMI of 32. The most modifiable risk factor here would be the weight, and there would be no reason to think about further intervention in this patient at this time because the lower the kPa score, the greater is the likelihood in terms of positive predictive value for excluding advanced fibrosis. This is great, and the last question also shows how quickly the thinking is evolving in that the majority of the audience did not select liver biopsy even though the patient might have had elevated liver enzymes, but instead the audience wanted to risk stratify the patient first using either a blood-based biomarker or FibroScan&reg;. I'm very impressed so far.</p>

<p>	In terms of lifestyle management, exercise has clearly been shown to be very effective in mobilizing fat in patients with NAFLD. A systematic review of 8 randomized trials and prospective cohort studies in adults has shown that exercise over 8 to 48 weeks with a frequently of 3 to 7 days per week at an intensity of 45 to 75 burning oxygen units was very effective in reducing or improving fat mobilization. Results were shown in 30% in the exercise-only group and 49% in the diet-and-exercise group, so clearly combining a low-carbohydrate diet with exercise is going to be even better than exercise alone. There are much data to support the benefits of lifestyle modification. Dietary plus exercise clearly augments fat reduction, and when you lose body fat, you're going to lose liver fat as well and lower your CAP score on FibroScan&reg;. The recommendation would be exercise 3 to 4 times a week for 20 to 40 minutes per session.</p>

<p>	Physical activity makes a difference, not just in removing fat from the liver but there's also significant data on the improvement in cardiovascular health. There's lots of improvements with physical exercise such as improving heart function and reducing cardiovascular mortality. You see many of the positive effects of exercise on the heart as well as changes to the liver, which would be beneficial in a patient with fatty liver disease by increasing peripheral insulin sensitivity, decreasing visceral fat, and increasing the clearance of very low density lipoproteins.</p>

<p>	Let's move on to our second case. This is a 45-year-old woman. She has a BMI of 33. She has a slightly elevated systolic blood pressure of 144. Her HbA<sub>1c</sub> is 5.5, right at the upper limit of normal. Her triglycerides are a little high. Her high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is 50, and her liver enzymes are slightly elevated. What would you do next? Again, you could use a predictive model to assess fibrosis, perform FibroScan&reg;, or refer for biopsy. This is different than the first case, in whom the liver enzymes are elevated. Compared with the last question, now 65% of you want to use FibroScan&reg;, probably because the liver enzymes are elevated and she has a borderline HbA<sub>1c</sub>. I Definitely more of you are selecting biopsy because you're recognizing this may be a phenotype of NASH and you want to document that.</p>

<p>	To biopsy or not to biopsy -- there's certain benefits of liver biopsy. It clearly makes the diagnosis of NASH, and these noninvasive fibrosis markers, either biomarkers or FibroScan&reg; or shear wave elastography, can clearly suggest that the patient has NASH. None of these techniques are full proof; to be absolutely certain of NASH and its fibrous severity as well as the inflammatory nature of the disease, you need a biopsy for confirmation. In certain situations, it's clearly indicated, but in others, it's not really necessary. It depends on how aggressive the patient wants to be; I individualize biopsy in my patients in terms of whether they really want to know, whether they want to get into clinical trials, or other reasons.</p>

<p>	Clearly, once you have a biopsy and you've documented the degree of fibrosis, as Zobair discussed, it's the fibrosis severity that determines the ultimate prognosis and outcome of the patient. However, there are clearly risks to biopsy. There are bleeding risks. You can have pain after the procedure. There is sample variability, but if you get an adequate length core, that tends to average out, and the procedure is clearly more costly than a serum test or a FibroScan&reg;.</p>

<p>	These list the various noninvasive serum-based tests that we can use to assist fibrosis in patients with fatty liver disease and possibly other liver disorders. All these tests are available through simple laboratory testing. The APRI score is simply based on the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value and platelet count. The NFS, which is proprietary and needs to be determined at a specific laboratory, as well as the BARD score and enhanced liver fibrosis score (ELF) are all proprietary and need to be done in a laboratory-based situation. But the FIB-4 is very easy to determine; recent data show that it can be very accurate in predicting NASH. If coupled with a FibroScan&reg; and the 2 have agreement, you have a high likelihood of knowing whether the patient has NASH.</p>

<p>	If you look at the various factors, laboratory studies, and other factors, those that make up the NFS are all those listed: age, liver transaminases -- both AST and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), platelet count, BMI, albumin, and clearly the fasting glucose level as a measure of insulin resistance. The FIB-4, on the other hand, is made up of only a few select values but still tends to correlate fairly well with fibrosis, and this includes liver transaminases and age.</p>

<p>	This patient has a BMI of 33, mild elevated liver enzymes, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 5.5. What would you recommend for this particular patient? Lifestyle management, diabetes control, antioxidant or anti-inflammatory therapy, or antifibrotic therapy? Most of you are choosing, again, lifestyle management. You want this patient to lose weight, although 20% of you want to start with diabetes control. Zobair, what do you think about these data?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Younossi:</strong>	I believe that lifestyle management is the only choice. Regarding diabetes control, there is no diabetes here, other than a slight increase in the HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Remember that antioxidant therapy with vitamin E is indicated by the guideline for patients who have biopsy-proven NASH without diabetes and cirrhosis. This patient does not have a biopsy result to qualify for antioxidant therapy. Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotics are really not in the scheme of what we can provide, so lifestyle management is the choice -- I agree with the majority.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Kowdley:</strong>	Let me jump in and ask a couple of questions.</p>

<p>	What if this patient went on an exercise and weight loss program and the ALT became normal. Would you then decide that you did not need a liver biopsy, and are there any conditions where, with a normal ALT regardless of the effect, you would consider a biopsy? I have my opinion. The second point that we want to be very clear is that, of course, NASH is a histologic diagnosis, so you can only diagnosis NASH based on a liver biopsy, not based on FibroScan&reg; results and not based on any other test result. That's an important point. The NFS is something, as you mentioned, Mitch, involves all clinical parameters that you can do based on routine testing, so it's not a proprietary test. What would you do, Zobair, if this patient&#8217;s enzymes normalize? In general, would you still proceed with a biopsy if the enzymes normalize or the liver enzymes improve? Let's say the enzymes get a little bit better, but they're not normal. Say they are still above 30 for a woman.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Younossi:</strong>	I don't perform biopsies much anymore. You have to recognize that when you look at weight loss studies and meta-analyses, 15% of those patients will lose weight and be successful in the long run. It is not just the weight loss; sustainability of weight loss is very, very hard. In the patient with multiple components of metabolic syndrome, I don't just do FibroScan&reg;; FIB-4, NFS, and APRI are in the chart because these are all free. You can get them on the Internet. Then I go to the FibroScan&reg;.</p>

<p>	If I have those 2 tests, despite the fact that the patient has improved enzymes, if those remain high, I would still have high suspicion for fibrosis. I'm a believer that it is not just an important driver of fibrosis but it is steatohepatitis. If you have fat with fibrosis, you basically define a patient with fatty liver disease who is at risk for an adverse outcome. That's all I want to know. The rest of the clinical parameters becomes moot.</p>

<p>	Do I perform a biopsy in that patient? No, but I would have a conversation that you still have a very high stiff liver, you still have a high FIB-4, you still have a very high APRI and NAFLD score, and maybe if you're going to consider a clinical trial, that you want to have a liver biopsy for both prognosis but also has an entry criterion for a clinical trial.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Kowdley:</strong>	If the patient has high-risk features suggestive of advanced fibrosis, you would proceed with a biopsy regardless of the lab test result.</p>

<p>	My addition to that is that if a patient has type 2 diabetes and you suspect NASH, then there is a lower threshold for proceeding with a biopsy because we know that in the patient with diabetes, ALT is not a very good predictor of underlying NASH. Then, of course, Mitch is going to tell us more about other therapies with regard to antioxidants.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Younossi:</strong>	Kris, when you look at studies of tertiary care centers and population-based studies and you look at independent predictors of advanced fibrosis, it's type 2 diabetes. Independent predictor of mortality -- it's diabetes in patients with fatty liver disease. I completely agree with you. Those are the patients who separate themselves in terms of high risk.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Shiffman:</strong>	I agree. What I said at the onset, when we looked at the overall phenotype of NASH, for me, it's elevated liver enzymes and diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Younossi:</strong>	Type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Shiffman:</strong>	Those are the patients who I talk about -- they may have significant NASH. Clearly, if they're interested in a clinical trial, we perform a biopsy at that point. However, if they say, no, there's no way -- I want medicine. I want to work at this on my own, I will give them an opportunity to lose weight with lifestyle modification and dietary changes, and we'll push exercise on them, and we'll give them information about what we think is the best way to do that. Then they'll come back. Unfortunately, the vast majority will not lose weight and then they will on to other options.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Younossi:</strong>	The thing that Kris brings up in terms of normalization of liver enzymes is really probably the basis of why we have cryptogenic cirrhosis, because these patients have basically have had normal liver enzymes. In fact, when you look at the clinical trials, about 10% to 15% of patients don't match the criteria because they have significant fibrosis but they may not have enough balloon cells to call it steatohepatitis. They are not "NASH" by definition, but they have significant damage. Some of these patients with normal liver enzymes can develop disease that's progressive, so that's a very important issue.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Shiffman:</strong>	We take it as a given that when you're talking about NAFLD or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, whether you're using the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism definition or the definition in most clinical trials, it's generally a cut-off of 30 g of alcohol per day for a man or 20 g of alcohol per day for a woman. Some studies use 20 and 10, respectively. If there is a patient who is drinking alcohol beyond that, then they wouldn't even have a diagnosis of NASH. But I think your point is very good in that there may be a greater level of underreporting of alcohol use than we are recognizing. But I think that's part of your first visit with a liver patient, just like you do with your experience. You review the use of herbal supplements, you're going to review the alcohol history, you're going to find out what other medications they're taking, etc. That's a given and it's sort of something we assume, but I'm glad you brought it up so that we're all on the same page.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Younossi:</strong>	Let me just contribute one point to this. We published an article last year in <em>Clinical Hepatology and Gastroenterology </em>looking at the overlap. If you look at the number of patients who have this overlap of alcoholic fatty liver disease and NAFLD, they have fatty liver disease or metabolic conditions in the context of drinking alcohol. In fact, when you have metabolic syndrome or you have diabetes or central obesity, the risk of alcohol damage to the liver is exaggerated by multiple times. It is probably the contribution of alcohol in the context of metabolic syndrome. We need to pay more attention to the overlap because we have a lot of patients who are obese and they drink more than they should. The cutoff is 10 to 20 g for men and women. But that role of how much alcohol is safe has not been completely determined. We come up with this threshold of 10 and 20 g, but is that correct for every patient? It may not be. If you have a patient with metabolic syndrome, 4 components of metabolic syndrome, who drinks 3 drinks a day, that may not be good for that patient. On the other hand, if you have a patient who's completely lean and has no component of metabolic syndrome, maybe 4 drinks will be fine. That has not been determined. It&#8217;s a very good question, by the way.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Shiffman:</strong>	Let's move on and talk about antioxidant therapy for a moment, and that's vitamin E, which was evaluated in the PIVENS trial several years ago. This was a phase 2 double-blind randomized trial comparing vitamin E, placebo, and pioglitazone in patients without diabetes. The bottom-line result showed that vitamin E was significantly better than placebo in improving NASH: 43% vs 19%. In a parallel study conducted in the pediatric population, which looked at vitamin E and metformin, neither vitamin E nor metformin was better than placebo at attaining sustained reduction in liver enzymes. However, vitamin E was superior to placebo in histologic improvement and resolution of NASH in almost double the number of patients. Clearly, antioxidant therapy, vitamin E, could be thought of in the nondiabetic population.</p>

<p>	Our third case is a 60-year-old man with type 2 diabetes who is taking metformin but not optimally controlled and not ready for insulin. His BMI is 36. What would you recommend for this patient? Lifestyle management, control of his diabetes, antioxidant therapy, inflammatory therapy, or fibrotic therapy? Better diabetes control, universal across the group. Kris, just a few comments so we can try to move along?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Kowdley:</strong>	This highlights the importance of where we as gastroenterologists need to be in managing these patients. In other countries, particularly Japan, it is increasingly common for gastroenterologists to be comfortable with recommending a particular diabetic regimen. For example, we know metformin doesn't have any particular activity against NASH, but there's certainly evidence with pioglitazone that in the carefully selected patient, it could be a very potent insulin sensitizer and, as in the PIVENS trial, may have some benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Shiffman:</strong>	These folks mentioned a couple of different off-label pharmacologic treatments of NAFLD and NASH. Metformin targets insulin resistance. There are several trials on that, although the majority of people who work in this field don't think that metformin has a huge benefit in this disease. Pioglitazone has been shown in a few different diseases to be beneficial. Liraglutide is similar, and we've already mentioned vitamin E therapy.</p>

<p>	This are data on pioglitazone from the PIVENS study. This happened to be a nondiabetic study, but there are several studies in patients with diabetes looking at pioglitazone. In this particular study, 58% of patients achieved the primary outcome of resolution of NASH. You can find similar results in studies of patients with diabetes. Pioglitazone treatment was associated with individual histologic score improvement including the fibrosis score in this study. Another agent that can be used is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GPL-1) analog; liraglutide is one of them that has been studied. These drugs work in several different organ systems, which can promote benefit to patients with NASH. In the liver, it reduces hepatic glucose production. In the brain, it's an appetite suppressant, so many patients taking liraglutide and other GLP-1 agents have a slight reduction in body weight, which probably helps the overall fatty liver disease.</p>

<p>	In the LEAN study, liraglutide was effective for resolution of NASH in overweight patients. You can see the data there; 39% of patients who received liraglutide and underwent end-of-treatment biopsy had resolution of definite NASH vs 9% in the placebo group. However, this study did not use fibrosis as an endpoint and fibrosis was not improved by liraglutide, although with longer-term follow-up and longer-term resolution of NASH, we may see some fibrosis resolution in these patients as well. It&#8217;s undefined as of yet.</p>

<p>	Let's finish up with our fourth case. This is a 38-year-old man who is morbidly obese. His BMI is 50, and he had a liver biopsy that shows stage 2 or 3 fibrosis, obviously without cirrhosis. What would you recommend for this patient with severe morbid obesity? Please vote for the same choices as before. Lifestyle management is clearly going to be important here. Antifibrotic therapy was the number one choice for most of you, although we really don't have good antifibrotic therapy right now. I think Kris is going to mention some exciting things in the pipeline for antifibrotic therapy.</p>

<p>	In the essence of time, I'm just going to move on and talk about some treatments for the severe obese. Lifestyle innovation programs and commercially available diets are important. There are maintenance phases. Phase 1 is the first 13 to 26 weeks with gradually replaced balanced diets limiting caloric intake to achieve weight loss. There are also protein-rich meals based on recommendations of the German Nutrition Society associated with severe caloric restriction for some of these patients. If you look at the results of some of these studies, weight loss is achieved in a large number of patients: 85%. The issue is maintenance of weight loss, if you come off these specific diets. Prevalence of fatty liver does decrease with this weight loss, from 98% to 54%. Liver enzymes come down in similar numbers. The prevalence of fibrosis also decreases with significant weight reduction, and low serum levels of adiponectin correlate with degree of liver damage in these patients.</p>

<p>	Bariatric surgery can also be used in patients with severe obesity. Compared with noncirrhotic and nonobese cirrhotic patients, severely obese cirrhotic patients have the highest mortality. From 85% to 95% of candidates for bariatric surgery have steatosis. At one of my offices, we have a very, very large, no pun intended, morbid obesity practice. Our surgeon performs biopsies on all of the patients. Occasionally, we find some strange histology in those patients, but the percentage of patients with fatty liver disease is probably over two-thirds in that population.</p>

<p>	Bariatric surgery may be considered for severely obese patients with BMIs of greater than 40 who clearly wish weight loss. Clearly bariatric surgery and weight reduction improve not just insulin resistance but also hypertension. There are several follow-up studies where patients have had a biopsy at the time of their bariatric surgery with a follow-up biopsy when they've reached their minimum weight, about a year following the procedure, showing significant reduction in fatty liver and even fibrosis improvement.</p>

<p>	Getting patients with NASH into care takes a lot of different people. There is significant increased risk of heart disease, so we need cardiologists. The disease is increasingly prevalent in children, so pediatricians need to be aware of this. Clearly, all these patients with diabetes are under the care of an endocrinologist or could benefit from that. Gynecologists who see patients with polycystic ovary disease and clearly the primary care provider who drives the ship on many of these patients can all refer patients to have their fatty liver disease evaluation. Thank you very much, and we'll turn it over to Kris.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Kowdley:</strong>	Thank you, Mitch. Those cases are illustrative of the kinds of patients that we see in clinical practice and of the tools that are available to us -- maybe vitamin E for some patients and bariatric surgery for others. Obviously, as was pointed out earlier, we have to review lifestyle modification, alcohol consumption, supplement use, etc.</p>

<p>	I'm going to move on and talk about the future, going over the emerging therapies for NASH based on efficacy and safety and how we've made the journey from our understanding of the mechanism of action to treatments in the clinic. This is a race. I've just chosen to highlight a few examples of the types of drugs that have been studied in phase 2 trials. Just to give you an example of antifibrotic targets, for example, a galectin-3 inhibitor used a hepatic venous pressure gradient change at 1 year as a marker for response. We have another study with a thyroid hormone receptor agonist that looked at changes in hepatic fat fraction assessed by proton density fat fraction, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-PDFF) at 12 weeks -- all the way from evaluation of hepatic venous pressure gradient to reduction in liver fat by MRI.</p>

<p>	There's another example of hepatic fat fraction assessed by MRI-PDFF with a fibroblast growth factor-19 memetic, which is a hormone that seems to enrich in the terminal ileum and may have effects on insulin signaling, anti-inflammatory activities, etc. Emricasan is a pan-caspase inhibitor. This is a class of drug that has been studied both in severe portal hypertension changes in hepatic venous pressure gradient and in ongoing studies to try to improve outcomes from a clinical liver-related standpoint.</p>

<p>	There are also several ongoing phase 3 trials for NASH. Obeticholic acid is an FXR agonist that is currently being studied in the REGENERATE trial and the REVERSE trial. The REGENERATE trial enrolls patients with stage 2 and 3 fibrosis. The REVERSE trial enrolls patients with cirrhosis. The primary endpoint for these studies, respectively, are greater than or equal to a 1-stage fibrosis improvement with no worsening of NASH or resolution of NASH with no worsening of fibrosis. If achieved, either of these coprimary endpoints would determine success. In the REVERSE trial, greater than a 1-stage fibrosis improvement without worsening of steatohepatitis is important because the natural history of NASH is one where the steatohepatitis component may burn out as the fibrosis progresses. If you're going to show improvement in NASH, it's got to be in the absence of worsening of fibrosis. Ideally, if you're going to show importance in fibrosis, it should be in the setting of no worsening of NASH.</p>

<p>	The cenicriviroc study has a mechanism of action to antagonize the CCR-2/CCR-5 receptor on macrophages. This is the AURORA trial with a greater than or equal to a 1-stage fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH. Elafibranor, which is a PPAR&#945;/&#948; dual agonist. is being studied in the RESOLVED trial, focusing on resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis.</p>

<p>	It's confusing but recognize that histology and liver biopsy are largely the tools we're using for these phase 3 trials. The outcomes we're assessing are either resolution of NASH or improvement in fibrosis or, ideally, both. Here's a polling question. Positive phase 3 data have been presented for which of the following compounds: cenicriviroc, elafibranor, obeticholic acid, or selonsertib? Obeticholic acid was chosen by 78%, with a smattering of others picking the other agents. The selonsertib monotherapy studies were completed but were negative for a positive drug effect. Obeticholic acid was, in fact, reported to have a positive phase 3 result and was presented by Dr Younossi at EASL just a few weeks ago. The cenicriviroc and elafibranor studies are currently in progress.</p>

<p>	Obeticholic acid received breakthrough therapy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The mechanism of action for this compound is via agonism to FXR, which is a hormone receptor in the liver. Activation of this hormone receptor leads to pleotropic effects with multiple mechanisms that were suggested in preclinical models, including direct antifibrotic effects. The phase 2b FLINT study, in which I was one of the investigators and which we conducted through the NASH Clinical Research Network, found that obeticholic acid at 25 mg/d for 72 weeks of treatment improved fibrosis and other histologic features of NASH. This was the only investigation to date to receive breakthrough therapy status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH with liver fibrosis.</p>

<p>	I want to take a few minutes and talk about FXR agonism because it's very interesting and there are multiple FXR agonists that are currently in the clinic and clinical trials. The possible various outcomes include improved glucose tolerance and reduced inflammatory effects by blocking cytochrome P450 SIP 7A. SIP 7A-1, as you can see, has a very favorable effect of both reducing bile acid production and increased bile acid excretion, reduction in hepatic triglycerides, improvement in portal pressure through SREBP-1C, and increased mitochondrial &#946;-oxidation of fats. The anti-inflammatory effects may further affect hepatic stellate cells with reduction in stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis.</p>

<p>	Here's the REGENERATE study. I feel like I'm stealing Zobair's thunder but he already presented the study at EASL, so now I'm going to present this and do a weak imitation. This is a phase 3 international randomized placebo-controlled study evaluating obeticholic acid for the treatment of NASH. An 18-month interim analysis was completed, and you can see the study design with a 1:1:1 randomization of placebo 10 mg/d and 25 mg/d. The endpoints were dual or coprimary endpoints: fibrosis improvement by more than 1 stage or 1-stage with no worsening of NASH or NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis. Success was defined as achievement of either of these 2 primary endpoints.</p>

<p>	Here are the results. Obeticholic acid 25 mg/d met the primary endpoint of improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of NASH, and this was highly significant compared with placebo. The antifibrotic effect was dose dependent and consistent across endpoints and key subgroups, suggesting that the antifibrotic effect was a mechanism that was an on-target effect. You can see 11.9%, 17.6%, and 23.1% of patients taking placebo 10 and 25 mg respectively achieved this primary endpoint of fibrosis improvement with no worsening of NASH. The diagram on the right shows the stability or instability or trend in the patients in various treatment arms, and you can see for the 25-mg group with obeticholic acid that there is a much higher proportion to the right, suggesting improved fibrosis, whereas as you come down that cascade to the placebo, there is about an even proportion of individuals with either improvement or worsening of fibrosis.</p>

<p>	The primary endpoint of NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis, however, was not met. But obeticholic acid improved NASH disease severity based on pathologists' histologic assessment of the key parameters such as the NAS score, ballooning, and lobular inflammation. You can see that NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis shows a slight trend but essentially no significant difference between 10 and 25 mg and no significant difference with placebo, which showed an 8% improvement.</p>

<p>	Moving on to talk about cenicriviroc, this is a novel mechanism because it's targeting the inflammatory response that activates macrophages and then may trigger or drive hepatocyte injury via fibrogenesis. There are a variety of different factors that could drive this inflammatory response, shown from left to right, with direct hepatocyte injury from lipotoxicity of free fatty acids, bacterial translocation via endotoxin such as tumor necrosis factor or lipopolysaccharide, which then can activate Kupffer cells, which demonstrate the CCR-2 and CCR-5 receptors that recruit CCL-2 and other chemokines, activate inflammatory macrophages, and then these signals activate stellate cells to become myofibroblasts and then lay down collagen tissue and extracellular matrix.</p>

<p>	The concept of the action of cenicriviroc is blocking the binding of this inflammatory macrophage to the hepatic stellate cell that then drives fibrogenesis. You have an inflammatory response to hepatocyte injury; you have an inflammatory macrophage that is now turned on, and the binding to the stellate cell and the progression of fibrogenesis are impeded.</p>

<p>	Here are the phase 2B results with cenicriviroc. This is a randomized, double-blind, multinational, phase 2B study of patients with NASH with an NAS of 4 or higher, fibrosis stages 1 to 3, and patients received either cenicriviroc or placebo. You can see that the primary endpoint improvement in NAS and no worsening of fibrosis was achieved in 18.8% vs 15.9%, and this was not significant. But when you look at the proportion of individuals who met the key secondary endpoint, which is improvement in fibrosis by more than 1 stage without worsening of steatohepatitis, about 2-fold as many patients in the treatment arm achieved that (20% vs about 10.4% in the control group).</p>

<p>	Elafibranor is a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)&#945;/&#948; agonist. PPARs are critical to a variety of processes in the liver, including fatty acid oxidation, reduction of triglycerides, raising high-density lipoproteins, and inflammatory pathways -- that's PPAR&#945;. PPAR&#948; has a key role in glucose homeostasis, energy metabolism, and inflammation. If you combine the 2, it would make sense that this might be a rational target. The GOLDEN 505 trial of elafibranor compared this agent with placebo in 276 patients with NASH, and the readout was resolution of NASH without fibrosis worsening at 52 weeks. You can see on the bar graph on the left and the right, the protocol-defined primary outcome and the modified definition of response, which showed statistical significance characterized by disappearance of ballooning and disappearance of mild persistence of lobular inflammation. Although when you look at the left bar graph, the differences are not statistically significant, with this modified definition, there was a difference particularly with 120 mg elafibranor, and this has now led the pathway to a phase 3 trial. Thank you very much.</p>
