<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 5; 02:30&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Undertreatment in Real-World Settings Can Lead to Suboptimal Gains in Vision<sup type="ref">[2-15]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	There is a huge burden for treatment visits</li>
<li>	There is a need for better optimized patient outcomes, such as a drug that is longer lasting, that would be more efficacious of drying the macula</li>
<li>	Real-world registries didn't achieve the similar results as in the pivotal large-scale prospective randomized trials </li>
<li>	Injection frequency is lower in the real world (real-world evidence studies, registries) compared to clinical trials</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 6; 03:45&gt;&gt;</strong>
<h3> Real-World Evidence Shows that Over 70% of Patients with nAMD are Undertreated in the First Year of Therapy<sup type="ref">[11,15]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Full funding in Australia delivered outcomes close to clinical trials</li>
<li>	Within Europe, a different funding system resulted in differences in outcome</li>
<li>	Fewer injections resulted in worse outcomes</li>
<li>	Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) outcomes in China and South America have been affected negatively by reimbursement issues for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 7; Chapter Title: Adherences Impacts Results of Therapy; 04:16&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Observational Study of FRB Database Eyes: Adherence to Treatment May Improve Results<sup type="ref">[16]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	More injections are associated with better results</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 8; 05:00&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> The Number of Injections Affects VA Results<sup type="ref">[17]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	There are 3 different silos of opportunity: 
<ul><li>	Provide patients initially with better vision</li>
<li>	Have a greater durability of the treatment</li>
<li>	Have a long-lasting effect</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 9; 06:02&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Objectives of the Treatment<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The treatment objective is to:
<ul><li>	Improve anatomical outcomes</li>
<li>	Dry the retina</li>
<li>	Minimize retinal fluid (to improve vision clinically)</li>
<li>	Then maintain results with less frequent treatment regimens</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 10; 07:01&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Real-World Evidence Highlights the Relationship Between Injection Frequency and VA Gains<sup type="ref">[18-19]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The next question is to evaluate if it is possible to stop the treatment in some patients</li>
<li>	More research on that topic is needed</li>
<li>	The recurrence rate is at least 50% in the first year (when treatment is stopped)</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 11; 07:37&gt;&gt;</strong>
<h3> Sustain Treatment: Adequate and Continued Anti-VEGF Therapy Can Maintain Long-Term Vision in the Real World<sup type="ref">[15-16]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The majority of patients need long-term treatment</li>
<li>	We have no predictive markers to tell in a given patient whether or not to stop treatment, or if they will recur 6 or 12 months later</li>
<li>	Studies in which patients do well -- and there is some remaining fluid -- were the end result of trials attempting to do everything possible to eradicate the fluid</li>
</ul>

<h3> Molecular Sizes of Anti-VEGF Agents<sup type="ref">[20-25]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Brolucizumab was designed to achieve longer durability, with less injection frequency, through a concentrated molar dosing enabled by a smaller molecular size</li>
<li>	Brolucizumab is the most advanced single-chain antibody variable fragment developed for ophthalmic use</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 14; 11:20&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> HAWK and HARRIER Studies: Brolucizumab Reduced Dosing Frequency<sup type="ref">[26]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The aim was to achieve a longer-term effect in the eye and to be potentially more efficacious</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 15; 11:40&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Patients treated with brolucizumab 6 mg had&#160;fewer visits in which&#160;sub-RPE fluid was observed from Week 36 to 48 <sup type="ref">[25]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	When examining the optical coherence tomography (OCT), and the fluid that is intraretinal and/or subretinal as well as sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), there was an approximately 30% greater reduction in the OCT with brolucizumab compared to aflibercept</li>
<li>	What those results suggest is that, given the molecular structure of the drug, brolucizumab has the potential to anatomically work more favorable versus aflibercept</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 16; 12:27&gt;&gt;</strong>
<h3> Conbercept for Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to nAMD: The PHOENIX Study<sup type="ref">[27]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Conbercept is a large recombinant fusion protein with an anti-VEGF activity </li>
<li>	The PHOENIX trial demonstrated a significant improvement of visual acuity (VA) on conbercept in Chinese nAMD patients</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 17; 12:41&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin&reg;): Abicipar Pegol<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></h3>

<li>	Abicipar pegol led to a high inflammation rate of about 15%</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 18; 13:05&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Phase 2 Studies Using RG7716<sup type="ref">[28-30]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	RG7716 is a bi-specific molecule with 2 fragment antigen-binding (Fab) arms</li>
<li>	One Fab arm is an anti-VEGF and the other is an anti-angiotensin (Ang)-2, with a modified fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion</li>

<h3> Patients treated with brolucizumab 6 mg had significantly&#160;fewer visits in which&#160;IRF and/or SRF was observed from Week 36 to 48<sup type="ref">[25]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Brolucizumab was shown to be noninferior in mean BCVA change from baseline to he primary endpoint of week 48, despite over 50% patients on the brolucizumab 6mg arm were treated on a q12w dosing immediately after loadingThere was a week 16 comparison that was very impactful because it allowed for a matched comparison based on identical dosing for brolucizumab and aflibercept</li>
<li>	From an anatomic point of view, brolucizumab was superior to aflibercept</li>
<li>	Brolucizumab significantly reduces central subfield thickness compared to aflibercept at 16 weeks </li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 23; Chapter Title: Other Emerging Therapies; 17:04&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Phase 3 CEDAR and SEQUOIA<sup type="ref">[33]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Abicipar is a 36 kDa molecule</li>
<li>	The problem with abicipar is inflammation</li>
<li>	A majority of patients could be early extended to injections every 12 weeks</li>
<li>	The phase 3 studies -- CEDAR and SEQUOIA -- indicate that patients were stabilized, but more information on patient VA evolution is needed</li>
<li>	In both studies, there was a 15% inflammation rate</li>
<li>	Safety is key in this area of treatment, especially with long-term treatment over 10 or 20 years with repeated injections </li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 24; 19:38&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Conbercept for Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to nAMD: The PHOENIX Study<sup type="ref">[27]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The reported incidence of inflammation with conbercept is not high </li>
<li>	Conbercept, a fusion protein, has great binding capacity, but did not show improved efficacy over other available agents Phase 3 trials are now starting in the United States and Europe</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 25; 21:35&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Targeting Key Angiogenic Pathways With RG7716<sup type="ref">[34]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	RG7716 is an anti-Ang-2/anti-VEGF dual molecule that has 2 Fab segments that combat the 2 parts of the pathological process Hypothetically, there is an interplay between VEGF-A and Ang-2</li>
<li>	The Fc portion has 6 mutations and has been optimized to decrease the amount of systemic exposure and inflammation</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 26; 23:43&gt;&gt;</strong>
<h3> RG7716 in the BOULEVARD Study<sup type="ref">[35]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The BOULEVARD study included patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) and showed very good results on macular edema</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 27; 23:53&gt;&gt;</strong>
<h3> Phase 2 Studies Using RG7716<sup type="ref">[28-30]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	The AVENUE study included patients with nAMD and showed the same results as with ranibizumab</li>
<li>	The STAIRWAY study included patients with nAMD and showed that 65% of patients have been extended to intervals of every 16 weeks </li>
<li>	The promising part of RG7716 is that it works via the tyrosine kinase receptor and integrins</li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 28; 24:50&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Phase 1/2a Data of OPT-302 in nAMD<sup type="ref">[36]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	OPT-302 is a pan-VEGF inhibitor</li>
<li>	Other agents that suppress VEGF-A are associated with an upregulation of VEGF-C and VEGF-D </li>
<li>	This upregulation may add to the resistance to VEGF-A mono-suppression -- which has been described in cancers (such as lung and colon cancer)</li>
<li>	In a 3-month study, OPT-302 showed that half of the patients had undetectable neovascular membranes </li>
</ul>
<strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 29; 26:12&gt;&gt; </strong>
<h3> Gene Therapy: The Example of RGX-314<sup type="ref">[37]</sup></h3>
<ul><li>	Most drugs and approaches using gene therapy in ocular and systemic disease have failed</li>
<li>	The eye is the ideal organ on which to perform gene therapy and there have been successes in monogenetic rare retinal dystrophies</li>
<li>	nAMD is a highly-attractive pathology for gene therapy</li>
<li>	The idea behind gene therapy in nAMD is to trigger protein production from cells that mimic an anti-VEGF effect rather than aiming to replace a faulty gene</li>
<li>	RGX-314 uses the AAV8 virus, which specifically delivers the gene to the retina</li>
<li>	RGX-314 is an anti-VEGF Fab</li>
