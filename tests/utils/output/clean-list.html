<strong>Study Highlights</strong>
<ul><li>	This meta-analysis examined primary data from pregnant women and their children from 6 international cohorts, including community-based cohorts in Denmark, Sweden, and Ontario, Canada, and clinic-based cohorts in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. </li>
<li>	Inclusion criteria for analysis were pregnancy resulting in a liveborn singleton between 1997 and 2015, availability of health-related data for both mother and infant, and presence of a mood disorder (bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) in the mother.</li>
<li>	Also included were women who received at least 2 dispensations of lithium during pregnancy any time from 1 month before conception until the delivery, or a single lithium dispensation during pregnancy and at least 1 other lithium dispensation within 6 months before or after this date. </li>
<li>	Exclusion criteria included prescription of known teratogenic drugs to the mother during pregnancy. </li>
<li>	A lithium-exposed group and a mood disorder reference group were compared in terms of main outcome measures of pregnancy complications, delivery outcomes, neonatal readmission to hospital within 28 days of birth, and congenital malformations, either major malformations or major cardiac malformations (atrial and atrioventricular septal defects and Ebstein's anomaly). </li>
<li>	Each site performed analyses using a shared protocol, including logistic regression models to calculate aORs and 95% CIs, as well as random effects meta-analytical models to pool site-specific prevalence rates and ORs.</li>
<li>	Across the 6 cohorts, there were 22,124 eligible pregnancies, including 727 lithium-exposed group pregnancies (557 [77%] from register-based cohorts and 170 [23%] from clinical cohorts). </li>
<li>	Compared with women not exposed to lithium during pregnancy, those exposed to lithium were more likely to be older, be nulliparous, and have filled a prescription for a psychotropic drug other than lithium during pregnancy.</li>
<li>	Lithium exposure was not associated with any of the predefined pregnancy complications or delivery outcomes, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, fetal distress, preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age.</li>
<li>	However, lithium exposure did confer a 62% increased risk for neonatal readmission to hospital within 28 days of birth (pooled prevalence, 27.5% [95% CI, 15.8%-39.1%] vs 14.3% [95% CI, 10.4%-18.2%]; pooled aOR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.12-2.33]). </li>
<li>	For lithium exposure during the first trimester, risk was increased for major malformations (pooled prevalence, 7.4% [95% CI, 4.0%-10.7%] vs 4.3% [95% CI, 3.7%-4.8%]; pooled aOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.07-2.72]), but there was no significant difference for major cardiac malformations (2.1% [95% CI, 0.5%-3.7%] vs 1.6% [95% CI, 1.0%-2.1%]; pooled aOR, 1.54 [95% CI, 0.64-3.70]).</li>
<li>	However, there were only 16 cases of major cardiac malformation across all sites, and no cases of Ebstein's anomaly. </li>
<li>	Additional sensitivity analyses, including stratification by study design, the leave-1-out approach, and adjustment for additional variables in a subcohort from Danish and Swedish data, did not significantly change the observed associations.</li>
<li>	On the basis of their findings, the investigators concluded that in light of the effect sizes and the precision of the estimates, treatment decisions for pregnant women with mood disorders should consider the potential for increased risks of lithium during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, against its efficacy at reducing relapse.</li>
<li>	Increased risk for neonatal readmission to hospital within 4 weeks of birth in infants with prenatal lithium exposure may have several potential underlying mechanisms. </li>
<li>	Lithium withdrawal after birth could directly cause neonatal morbidity, as could lithium exposure via breast-feeding, which is generally not recommended. </li>
<li>	The underlying maternal mood disorder or increased vigilance toward infants exposed to lithium and subsequent increased detection of neonatal morbidity could also play some role.</li>
<li>	Mental illness itself has been associated with preterm birth, cesarean delivery, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, regardless of pharmacotherapy.</li>
<li>	Risk for relapse in women with bipolar disorder is significant during pregnancy and postpartum, based on previous studies. </li>
<li>	Decisions regarding lithium treatment should be encouraged before conception. </li>
<li>	To facilitate balanced decision making, clinicians should counsel women with mood disorders about the malformation risks for lithium exposure during the first trimester and about the high relapse risks during pregnancy and postpartum if lithium treatment is tapered. </li>
<li>	In light of the well-documented efficacy of lithium in reducing relapse during the perinatal period, 1 important clinical consideration suitable for some women is to restart lithium after the first trimester or immediately postpartum. </li>
<li>	Future studies should examine relapse risk associated with reducing lithium dose during the first trimester and should aim to identify other treatment options.</li>
<li>	Study limitations include analysis only of pregnancies resulting in live births because of limited data on stillbirths at some study sites, lack of power to study very rare events, observational design with possible residual confounding, potential for type I error and chance findings, lack of an active comparator, and no data on lithium serum concentrations precluding analyses of dose-response associations. </li>
<li>	In addition, less severe adverse outcomes are more likely to be reported in the lithium-exposed group because of general concern regarding teratogenic effects. </li>
<li>	An accompanying editorial highlights study limitations of lack of data regarding the potential effect of lithium dose and failure to account for obesity, alcohol, smoking, substance misuse, or other potentially important confounders associated with increased risk for malformations, pregnancy complications, and worse outcomes. </li>

<strong>Clinical Implications</strong>
(Insert text - relates to each learning objective) 
(Insert text - Implications for the Healthcare Team, when applicable).
<ul><li>	Lithium exposure during pregnancy was associated with significantly increased risks for neonatal readmission to hospital within 4 weeks postpartum, and of major congenital malformations, but not major cardiac malformations, based on a meta-analysis of combined data from 6 international cohorts. </li>
<li>	To facilitate balanced decision making, clinicians should counsel women with mood disorders about the malformation risks for lithium exposure during the first trimester and about the high relapse risks during pregnancy and postpartum if lithium treatment is tapered. </li>
<li>	Implications for the Healthcare Team: In utero exposure to lithium was not associated with significantly increased risks for any of the pregnancy complications or delivery outcomes investigated. </li>
