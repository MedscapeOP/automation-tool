<strong>Study Highlights</strong>

&amp;#8226;	The observational cohort for this study consisted of 1195 patients in a cerebrovascular clinic from February 17, 2015 to January 27, 2017.

&amp;#8226;	Mean age was 62&amp;#177;15 years; 81% were white; median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at the clinic visit was 1 (interquartile range, 0-2).

&amp;#8226;	As part of their routine care, all these patients completed Neuro-QoL executive function and PROMIS scales of physical function, satisfaction with social roles, fatigue, anxiety, depression, pain interference, and sleep disturbance.

&amp;#8226;	The percentage of patients with scores meaningfully worse than the general population ranged from 28% for sleep disturbance to 63% for physical function. 

&amp;#8226;	Patients with higher mRS scores had worse PROMIS scores, but correlation varied, ranging from <em>r</em> =0.16 for sleep disturbance to <em>r</em> =0.52 for physical function. 

&amp;#8226;	The most affected domains among patients with stroke were physical function (T score, 58.8), satisfaction with social roles (T score, 55.4), and executive function (T score, 53.4). 

&amp;#8226;	Correlations were modest for fatigue, depression, pain, and anxiety, which are likely affected by multiple psychosocial factors, including coping styles, social support, and economic burden.

&amp;#8226;	For all domains except depression and sleep disturbance, PROMIS scores were worse than in the general population, but patients with mRS score of zero (no symptoms) were not worse than the general population on any reported domains.

&amp;#8226;	Scores remained relatively stable in patients with disability levels ranging from mild to severe (mRS score, 2-5). 

&amp;#8226;	Factors associated with worse scores in multiple domains were disability, lower income, and female sex. 

&amp;#8226;	Older age was associated with worse physical function but with lower scores for anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance.

&amp;#8226;	Based on their findings, the investigators concluded that compared with the general US population, patients with ischemic stroke seen in ambulatory clinics reported worse function across multiple domains of health.

&amp;#8226;	The symptom domains most often affected were physical function, satisfaction with social roles, and executive function whereas anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance were less common in this cohort

&amp;#8226;	At higher levels of disability, these symptoms were proportionately more common, with the correlation varying by symptom. 

&amp;#8226;	The emotional burden of stroke may be greater in younger patients because of greater societal demands related to work and social roles as family provider or parent.

&amp;#8226;	The investigators suggested that their findings enhance understanding of the well-being of patients with ischemic stroke and highlight the importance of social roles and executive function for stroke survivors.

&amp;#8226;	Although physical limitations are well recognized after stroke and are typically most often targeted by rehabilitation, social participation and cognitive functioning may not always be addressed or even recognized.

&amp;#8226;	The mRS, which is most often used to evaluate disability after stroke, is heavily weighted toward mobility and does not incorporate disturbances in sleep, cognition, anxiety, and depression.    

&amp;#8226;	Interventions to increase social participation, particularly those involving exercise, have been shown to be effective.

&amp;#8226;	In contrast, cognitive impairment after stroke may not benefit from rehabilitation. 

&amp;#8226;	Still, social support programs and strategies that accommodate patients&amp;#8217; level of cognitive functioning may be helpful.

&amp;#8226;	Stroke centers and clinicians caring for patients with stroke of all degrees of severity should assess for problems with social participation and cognitive functioning and other health domains and offer appropriate interventions, particularly as different domains of health are differentially affected with increasing levels of disability. 

&amp;#8226;	Although sleep disturbance was the least affected of the reported domains, more than half of patients with stroke are known to have sleep-disordered breathing, accompanied by worse functional status and increased mortality.

&amp;#8226;	Lack of sleepiness and snoring reported by other patients with sleep-disordered breathing hinders screening patients with stroke for this condition and may partially explain why sleep disturbance was the least affected domain in this study.

&amp;#8226;	This study is one of the largest analyses to date of patient-reported outcomes after stroke collected as part of routine care, which increases the generalizability of the findings.

&amp;#8226;	Nonetheless, study limitations include lack of assessment of several other domains affected by stroke, including communication and other aspects of cognition; study cohort from a single institution with patients who predominantly had mild stroke; and possible selection bias. 

&amp;#8226;	An accompanying editorial noted differences in the health domain outcomes depending on the timing of measurement of outcome after stroke, suggesting a possible need to repeat assessments over time and to monitor outcomes that are most important to patients.

<strong>Clinical Implications</strong>

&amp;#8226;	Compared with the general US population, patients with ischemic stroke seen in ambulatory clinics reported worse function across multiple domains of health, including certain nonphysical domains.

&amp;#8226;	The findings enhance understanding of the well-being of patients with ischemic stroke and highlight the importance of social roles and executive function for stroke survivors.

&amp;#8226;	Implications for the Healthcare Team: Although physical limitations are well recognized after stroke and are typically most often targeted by rehabilitation, social participation and cognitive functioning may not always be addressed or even recognized.
