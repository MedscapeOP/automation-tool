<p><strong>Harold Bays, MD:</strong>    Hello, my name is Dr Harold Bays. Medical director and president of the Louisville Metabolic and Atherosclerosis Research Center located in Louisville, Kentucky. Today we are going to talk about statin therapy and patients with insulin resistance, and we are going to talk about some very interesting data, some unique data with a focus on hepatic fat. We are fortunate enough to have with us today, Dr Laurie Braun. Laurie, why don't you tell the folks a little bit about yourself?</p>

<p><strong>Laurie Braun, MD:</strong>   Thank you so much for having me. I am Laurie Braun. I am a pediatric endocrinologist at Mass General Hospital for Children in Boston and I am an instructor at Harvard Medical School. In addition, I recently completed a clinical study looking at the effects of statins on insulin sensitivity and liver fat.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Okay. So before we get into that, just right off the bat, how many of these types of evaluations have been done? We talk a lot about the potential of statins and their effects upon the liver with regard to, maybe, glucose or insulin sensitivity, or hepatic fat. How many other studies have been done to look at this in the past?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   There have been many retrospective meta-analysis-type studies and a lot of prospective observational studies, but there haven't really been any prospective randomized placebo-controlled trials looking specifically at the effect of statins on insulin sensitivity.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    This is kind of, a mechanistic study that you conducted. Is that right?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Personally, I think that was long overdue. That is what we are going to talk about today. We are going to review the data that you talked about, about the effects of statin on hepatic fat and insulin sensitivity, and these types of things. I think before we get started, just to give some perspective. The fact is, when we first started developing the statins, initially, there was a suggestion there might actually be an improvement in glucose levels.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Yes</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Some of the earlier days in the pravastatin studies, there was actually an improvement in glucose levels. As time went on, we developed additional statins, seemed to increase glucose levels. So I think that's pretty well established that, with the exception of pravastatin and then the statin we're getting ready to talk about here in a minute, they generally do increase glucose levels. Who are the people that tend to get that increase in glucose levels? They are the people that are at risk for diabetes anyway, which would ... people as they get older, higher statin
doses, maybe have the prediabetes, overweight and those types of things. The other point I want to get across, just so everybody knows, nothing that we talk about here today should suggest that we shouldn't be using statins in patients with diabetes mellitus. So whether it be primary prevention or secondary prevention, statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in our patients with the diabetes. Now, the thing that has come to pass is, like I said, pravastatin hasn't shown that ability or that characteristic of maybe increasing glucose levels. You could say the same thing about pitavastatin.  What statin did you choose when you made the decision to do this study?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Yeah, exactly. In this study, we used pitavastatin. As you said, when you are looking at these meta-analyses or these retrospective studies, there was a small but statistically significant increased risk of developing new-onset diabetes when taking a statin. It came to attention with the JUPITER study, which was a long prospective study with rosuvastatin. So we set out to conduct a vigorous, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study looking at a newer statin, pitavastatin, to really vigorously study its effects on insulin sensitivity using a gold standard
insulin clamp.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    I'm assuming you picked pitavastatin is because there had been some data suggesting, perhaps it didn't have that characteristic of increasing glucose levels. Is that correct?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Exactly. That's correct, and that's why we chose pitavastatin. So in this study, we were looking for people who were at risk for developing diabetes but who did not yet
have overt diabetes. -</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   They did not have diabetes when entering the study. They were not on any medications, such as metformin. We studied men, between the ages of 40 and 65. These were people at risk, so they were obese. They had a body mass index (BMI) greater than 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. They were centrally obese, so they had abdominal adiposity, waist circumference greater than 102 cm. They were not already taking a statin, but they were not already taking any diabetes medications like metformin. However, they did have some evidence of prediabetes or some evidence of insulin resistance. The criteria we used to determine that was to have a fasting blood sugar of between 100 or 126 mg/dl or a 2-hour blood sugar on an oral glucose tolerance test of between 140 and 200.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    So they had to have fasting hyperglycemia, but not in the range of diabetes. I have done these trials and I know that a lot of their patients they see that have them, but when you try to find these folks for clinical trials, my experience is hard. We have found it hard to recruit for these studies. We ultimately get it done. I guess I must congratulate you in finding
these folks and be able to get the data that they generate. Okay. When you are conducting the trial, how did you assess insulin sensitivity? How did you do that?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   That is a great question. You may see, in some other studies, looking for markers of diabetes such as oral glucose tolerance tests or fasting blood sugars. Those kind of tests, if I were to take your fasting blood sugar today, tomorrow, six months from now, I may get a very different value. That may not signify you actually have a change in your insulin sensitivity. In addition, if I were to take your hemoglobin A1c today and six months from now, it may actually be the same. You may actually have a small change in insulin sensitivity that we are not detecting. That is why, in this study, we used a technique called a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    What is that? For the folks that do not know, I mean, what on Earth is the insulin clamp thing you speak of? I mean, what is this?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   The clamp is a gold standard research test for detecting insulin sensitivity. This is statin, as I said, it is reproducible. So if I were to take your clamp measurement
today and tomorrow it should be the same and if it's different in six months, that's sensitive enough to detect a true change. What we do is, we have patients come into a research setting. We hook them up to 2 IVs. We take frequent blood glucose concentration measurements every five minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Every five minutes. For how long?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   This lasts for 6 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Who actually did this work in your study? Who did most of this work?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   I was the one who was sitting at the bedside.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    You sat there by the bed and did the actual ... Okay. Well, we are talking the right person then. </p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   So how we measure insulin sensitivity is we give an insulin infusion. We give a low dose of insulin infusion. If you do not have diabetes and you give someone insulin, you would expect that would drop their blood sugar. That is why we are sampling every five minutes. Now, we want to clamp your blood sugar in the normal range, or at 90 mg/dl. So we are fixing the amount of insulin, we're fixing your blood glucose concentration at 90, and then we're giving a dextrose infusion and we're varying the rate of dextrose in order to keep your blood sugar constant at 90. If
you have someone who's very sensitive to insulin, who is not in the diabetes range, you would expect that they'd need a lot of dextrose to keep their blood sugar stable at 90.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    If they were a high insulin sensitivity, right?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Exactly. So you need to turn up that glucose infusion.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Right, right. You would have to give them the glucose to counteract the insulin. </p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   However, if you have someone who is on their way to developing diabetes and they are not very sensitive to insulin, they might not need a lot of dextrose to keep their blood sugar stable at 90. That is why this is a very sensitive gold standard research test for study.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays</strong>:    So when they say euglycemic, you are keeping the glucose at 90. Hyperinsulinemic means you are giving them insulin.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   We actually used 2 different doses of insulin in 2 portions. One was a low dose of insulin to look at hepatic insulin sensitivity, and then a high dose to look at peripheral insulin sensitivity.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    That is the glucose side. The other side would be the hepatic fat. I have been an investigator about somewhere over 500 clinical trials and such, and at least the liver
studies we do, the hepatic fat studies that we do, we often used the FibroScan for screening. Then, if they meet the screening, we send them for magnetic resonance spectroscopy. What did you use to look at liver fat?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Yeah, so we did use the technique of MRI spectroscopy. This is a sensitive test that is non-invasive.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Non-invasive, because the alternative would have been to liver biopsy. Patients seem to want to gravitate away from a liver biopsy. </p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Exactly. That is a pretty invasive test, requires sedation. So the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spectroscopy is a non-invasive test where we have a patient in an MRI scanner. We have a skilled radiologist who focuses in on a specific portion of the liver and looks for the spectroscopy peaks of fat and water. Moreover, by looking at the ratio of fat to water, we can calculate, using a computer program, the percentage of liver fat, in a non-invasive way.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    All right. So you recruit these patients. Who were these patients, ultimately? When you were done recruiting them, who were they?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   These were obese individuals. They had an average BMI of around 33. They were centrally obese. Really, that central adiposity really puts you at risk for getting diabetes, when you have a high waist circumference. We looked at their MRI. They also had a high amount of visceral adipose tissue.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    And they were all men with central adiposity, okay, and some degree of hyperglycemia, I would say. </p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Right. So yeah, when we looked at their baseline clamp studies, they did have some degree of insulin resistance at baseline but they did not have overt diabetes. These were people who could benefit from being on a statin, as well. These people had 10-year cardiovascular risk scores of around 7% and LDLs all around 130. In this six-month study, pitavastatin did not change insulin sensitivity. It was neutral.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Neutral. Okay. What about in liver fat?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Again, we did not see any changes in liver fat over the course of six months.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Okay. I mean, in some ways, it would have been nice if there had been some improvement in glucose levels or improvement in insulin sensitivity or improvement in liver fat. Nevertheless, it did not make it worse. Right?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   It did not make it worse. We looked at a few sensitive measures. As I mentioned, we looked at hepatic insulin sensitivity, whole-body insulin sensitivity. We looked at the rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis, and people on pitavastatin versus people on placebo. We just did not see a change.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    That would be in contrast to many of the other statins that people typically use, where, in fact, not only do you get ... increases glucose levels, but actually an increase in new-onset diabetes and all, with the exception of maybe pravastatin. So now, let us just say a clinician has a patient. The patient says, "You're asking me to take this statin but I'm very concerned about getting the diabetes." It is odd how people seem to be ... Some people seem to worry more about getting diabetes than they do heart disease sometimes. Based upon the data, objective data, if you did have a clinician that was facing that dilemma with a patient, and the patient would say, "Are there any statins out there for which I would have less concern about problems with insulin insensitivity."</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   So they may choose a particular statin like the one we used in this study, pitavastatin, which, in a six-month study, did not have an effect on markers of diabetes. I would also emphasize the point that statins reduce cardiovascular mortality, and that has a clear benefit over the small risk of diabetes with particular statins.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    That is a great point to bring back up, because that is exactly what we said at the beginning. Particularly in our patients that already had the diabetes mellitus, whether it is primary prevention or secondary prevention, statins are going to help save lives. Reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, so I think we definitely have to say that. However, for those patients out there, wherein being on a statin that might increase glucose levels, that is a barrier to treatment, I think what you can say is pravastatin is a possibility. At least, based upon your study, and other meta-analyses, in fairness, in other meta-analyses and such, pitavastatin may be another treatment option. Would you agree with that?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Yes. </p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Okay. So now we have all this data and such. Once you are implementing these types of treatment and educating patients on the use of statins, whether it is the pravastatin, pitavastatin, with regard to glucose, or all the other statins as well, what do you imagine is some of the more effective ways to get patients to adhere to therapies that are recommended?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Well, it really does take a team approach. You know, so many people are involved in caring for these patients, whether it be the doctors, the nurses, nurse practitioners, dieticians, everyone really needs to work together to help people get the treatment they need.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Right. I think I would extend ... I think you would agree with this. Sometimes just the office staff, right?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Of course, yeah.</p>

<p>Dr Bays:     The people that are helping with the refilling the prescription or when they check in. As you mentioned, nurse practitioners, nurses, diabetes nurse educators, if there are exercise physiologists around. Having everybody engaged, having family, family friends involved, I mean, it just takes everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   Absolutely.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays</strong>     So in conclusion, what I would say is that statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. And among patients with the diabetes mellitus, it reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, whether it be primary prevention or secondary prevention. Nothing that we said here should dissuade clinicians from using statins in patients in whom it would benefit in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The data would also suggest that not all statins are alike when it comes to increasing the risk of increases in glucose levels. It could be that pravastatin, and based
upon the data that you present here, pitavastatin, may have the least potential towards increasing the glucose levels. With specific regard to your study and pitavastatin, how would you summarize this?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Braun:</strong>   I would say that in a six-month study, pitavastatin did not affect insulin sensitivity or liver fat.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Bays:</strong>    Well, that is a very succinct conclusion. Well, thank you very much. All right, well, thank you for being here and thank you for participating in this activity.
