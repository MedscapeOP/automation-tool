<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Prevalence Rates of CV Comorbidities in Persons With T2DM: Results of a Systematic Literature Review<sup>[1]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	In this systematic literature review by Einarson and colleagues, data from over 4.5 million persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were analyzed</p>

<p>&#8226;	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affected more than 30% of these individuals, with atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and heart failure the most common CVD conditions</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 5 Timecode: 03:07&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Controlling Glycemia Reduces Microvascular Complications: DCCT<sup>[2]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) showed definitively that intensive control of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in persons with diabetes significantly reduced the onset of microvascular complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, when compared with conventional interventions that did not result in tight HbA1c control</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 6 Timecode: 03:53&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Intensive Glycemic Control Increased All-Cause Mortality (ACCORD)<sup>[3-5]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	In the ACCORD trial, very strict control of HbA1c was associated, somewhat paradoxically, with an increase in mortality compared with the less-intensive regimen. It has been proposed that a greater incidence of hypoglycemia, associated with stricter control in ACCORD, may have increased the risk of mortality, particularly in frailer patients</p>

<p>&#8226;	However, in other cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs), such as VADT and ADVANCE, tighter HbA1c control was not associated with greater mortality</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Underlying Clinical Factors Influencing Incidence of Hypoglycemia in Patients with T2DM<sup>[6]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Hypoglycemia may occur more frequently, and with greater risk of deleterious outcomes, in some subgroups of patients with T2DM</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 8 Note to EA &#8211; Cardiovascular Safety Trials Timecode: 05:35&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; CV Safety Trials for the Gliptins: What Was the Point?</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	CVOT results were disappointing for the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class of antiglycemic agent</p>

<p>&#8226;	Indications from the pivotal trials of such DPP-4 inhibitors as saxagliptin, alogliptin, and sitagliptin suggested that some CV benefit would be evident; but this was not the case</p>

<p>&#8226;	DPP-4 inhibitors are neutral with respect to CV benefit or harm</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 9 Timecode: 06:40&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; EMPA-REG OUTCOME and LEADER: Paradigm Shift in T2DM Treatment</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The positive CV results of EMPA-REG OUTCOME (the sodium glucose co-transport inhibitor empagliflozin) trial and the LEADER (the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist [GLP-1 RA] liraglutide) trial have been hailed as inaugurating a paradigm shift in the treatment of T2DM</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 10 Timecode: 08:00&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; DPP-4 Inhibitors -- Topline Clinical Trial Results<sup>[7]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The absence of CV benefit, in combination with modest effects on HbA1c and other T2DM parameters, have caused some clinicians to question the utility of the DPP-4 inhibitor class</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 11 Timecode: 09:16&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Comparison of MET + SU vs MET + DPP-4i: All-Cause Mortality<sup>[8]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	In this study, Ericksson and colleagues compared the combination of metformin and sulfonylurea (MET + SU) vs metformin and DLL-4 inhibitor (MET + DPP-4i) across a number of safety concerns: Severe hypoglycemia, CV events, and all-cause mortality</p>

<p>&#8226;	The MET + SU combination was associated with higher risk of all safety endpoints compared with the MET + DPP-4i combination</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 12 Timecode: 10:49&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; EMPA-REG OUTCOME: Results for CV Death<sup>[9]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The significant difference favoring empagliflozin (<em>P</em> =.04) in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME primary outcome of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and nonfatal stroke was driven primarily by a 38% reduction in CV mortality </p>

<p>&#8226;	Empagliflozin also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 35% compared with placebo</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 13 Timecode: 11:52&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; EMPA-REG OUTCOME and Stroke<sup>[10]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	A potentially troubling finding in EMPA-REG OUTCOME was the numerical imbalance in stroke occurrence favoring placebo, with most of the empagliflozin-associated strokes occurring after termination of the study drug</p>

<p>&#8226;	An additional analysis of the stroke data undertaken by Zinman and colleagues found no significant increase in stroke risk with empagliflozin</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 14 Timecode: 13:13&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; CANVAS: 2-Fold Increase in Risk of Amputation, Canagliflozin vs Placebo<sup>[11]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The CANVAS trial, which compared the cardiovascular safety of canagliflozin vs placebo, reported a 14% reduction in the primary outcome favoring canagliflozin, which met noninferiority specification (<em>P</em> &lt;.001); the investigators also reported <em>P</em> =.02 for superiority</p>

<p>&#8226;	There were some troubling safety results, however, such as an increased risk for amputation and an increased risk for bone fracture, including low-trauma fracture, associated with canagliflozin vs placebo</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 15 Timecode: 15:54&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Liraglutide Is a Once-Daily, Human GLP-1 Analogue<sup>[12,13]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Liraglutide is an acylated GLP-1 derivative that, by binding to albumin, delays its degradation by DPP-4 as well as delaying absorption from the injection site</p>

<p>&#8226;	A prolonged pharmacokinetic profile is thus attained, giving liraglutide a half-life of ~12 hours</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 16 Timecode: 16:54&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; LEADER: Primary Outcome Results<sup>[14]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	LEADER evaluated the CV safety and efficacy of liraglutide, a GLP-1 RA</p>

<p>&#8226;	There was a statistically significant (<em>P</em> =.01) 13% relative risk reduction favoring liraglutide in the composite major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) primary endpoint of CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 17 Timecode: 17:35&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; LEADER: Results for CV Death<sup>[14]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	As with empagliflozin, the primary endpoint MACE result in LEADER was primarily driven by a significant reduction in CV death in the liraglutide cohort, where the risk reduction was 22% compared with placebo</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 18 Timecode: 18:16&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Other Improvements Observed With Liraglutide in LEADER<sup>[14]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	In addition to the CV benefits associated with liraglutide treatment in LEADER, the agent was also associated with a number of other relevant pathophysiologic improvements</p>

<p>&#8226;	It has been hypothesized that these improvements contributed to the CV benefits observed with liraglutide in this trial</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 19 Timecode: 19:10&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; SUSTAIN-6 (Semaglutide): Primary Outcome Results<sup>[15]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Results from the SUSTAIN-6 safety study of once-weekly semaglutide demonstrate significant reductions (<em>P</em> =.02) in first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke, the composite primary endpoint with the GLP-1 RA vs placebo</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>These results were primarily driven by reductions in nonfatal stroke, which occurred in 1.6% and 2.7% of semaglutide and placebo, respectively (<em>P </em>&lt;.04)</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 20 Note to EA &#8211; How Should These New Agents Be Used? Timecode: 20:06&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; New Paradigm for Treating the Patient With Both T2DM and CVD<sup>[16]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Diabetologists, and even cardiologists, now have the luxury of available agents that not only provide CV benefit, but also, because of their distinctive mechanisms, may be particularly useful for patients with specific kinds of CVD</p>

<p>&#8226;	Accordingly, a patient with T2DM and heart failure might benefit from empagliflozin, while a patient with T2DM, atherosclerosis, and obesity might benefit from liraglutide or semaglutide</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 21 Timecode: 20:50&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; How Big a Problem Is Needle Phobia?</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	So-called needle phobia, and resistance to medications that require injection, may not be as big a problem as has been surmised</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Modern injection technologies are relatively painless, and patients can be convinced to administer the agent that will do them the most good -- even if that agent must be injected</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 22 Timecode: 21:46&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Side Effects Associated With Liraglutide<sup>[14]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The gastrointestinal side effects associated with liraglutide tend to occur, if they occur, early in the treatment phase and usually disappear over time.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Dose titration can also mitigate side effects</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 23 Timecode: 23:00&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Is There an Impact on Retinopathy With GLP-1 RAs?<sup>[17]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Large studies have not shown an association between GLP-1 RAs and retinopathy</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Incidence of Pancreatitis in LEADER<sup>[14]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Large trials of GLP-1 RAs have shown no association between the agent and either pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 25 Timecode: 26:04&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Potential Mechanisms for CV Benefit Associated With Empagliflozin<sup>[18]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Glucose reduction certainly helped to achieve CV benefit</p>

<p>&#8226;	But so, too, did a number of other effects associated with sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition</p>

<p>&#8226;	Natriuresis, water loss, and glycosuria associated with SGLT2 inhibitors -- but without causing potassium changes or changes in osmolality -- are likely to de-stress the heart and reduce cardiac afterload and preload</p>

<p>&#8226;	Fluid losses associated with SGLT2 inhibitors are also likely to improve intravascular volumes and systolic blood pressure (BP); these changes are reflected in a rise in hematocrit</p>

<p>&#8226;	A shift to ketone metabolism may also help to improve cardiac function</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Changes in Global Longitudinal Strain at 6 Months, Liraglutide vs Metformin<sup>[19]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Among the mechanisms proposed to explain the CV benefit observed with liraglutide in LEADER and semaglutide in SUSTAIN-6 was an improvement in arterial stiffness in patients with atherosclerosis</p>

<p>&#8226;	In this study, Lambadiari and colleagues compared liraglutide vs metformin across a number of parameters (eg, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, longitudinal strain) indicative of arterial stiffness and left ventricular myocardial deformation</p>

<p>&#8226;	At 6 months, liraglutide improved markers of arterial stiffness and left ventricular myocardial strain to a numerically greater extent than metformin</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Clear-Cut Clinical Roles for Liraglutide and Empagliflozin</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Clear-cut clinical roles for SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are beginning to be established</p>

<p>&#8226;	These roles are, or should be, dependent upon the type of CV or cardiorenal dysfunction presented by each individual patient with T2DM</p>
