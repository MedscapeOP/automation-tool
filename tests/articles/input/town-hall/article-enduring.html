<p><strong>Question Introduction (</strong><strong>optional &#953;):</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Question </strong>#<strong>1:</strong> The addition of midostaurin to intensive induction chemotherapy is associated with a significantly increased risk of which grade &#8805; 3 nonhematologic toxicity?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Rash</p>

<p>&#8226;	Infection</p>

<p>&#8226;	Diarrhea</p>

<p>&#8226;	Pneumonitis</p>

<p>Answer explanation: The addition of midostaurin to intensive induction chemotherapy is associated with a significantly increased risk of grade &#8805; 3 rash.</p>

<p><strong>Question type:</strong> CME Posttest</p>

<p><strong>Question Introduction (</strong><strong>optional &#953;):</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Question </strong>#<strong>2:</strong> Sarah, a 62-year-old female, has developed relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that was initially treated with intensive induction chemotherapy. After her workup reveals a <em>FLT3</em>&#8211;internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation, you recommend gilteritinib, which is available where you practice. Sarah expresses concern about not using chemotherapy. What would you say based on current evidence?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Gilteritinib has shown a high response rate though we don't yet know if patients live longer with gilteritinib compared with chemotherapy</p>

<p>&#8226;	Patients receiving gilteritinib are more likely to enter remission than those receiving chemotherapy but there is no survival difference</p>

<p>&#8226;	Patients receiving gilteritinib are more likely to enter remission and live longer than those receiving chemotherapy</p>

<p>Answer explanation: According to results from the ADMIRAL trial, gilteritinib is significantly more effective than chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory <em>FLT3</em>-mutated AML as assessed by response rates and overall survival (OS).  </p>

<p><strong>Question type:</strong> CME Posttest</p>

<p><strong>Question Introduction (</strong><strong>optional &#953;):</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Question </strong>#<strong>3:</strong> In the QuANTUM-R trial, which of the following outcomes was significantly superior with quizartinib vs chemotherapy?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Event-free survival</p>

<p>&#8226;	Event-free survival and OS</p>

<p>&#8226;	OS but not event-free survival</p>

<p>Answer explanation: In the QuANTUM-R trial, quizartinib associated with a significant improvement in OS over chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory <em>FLT3</em>-ITD AML but it was not associated with an improvement in event-free survival. </p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=8TplOIZ53W0Uvu-qEdHkWXD682LLqRQybOlvoJBKHBzaqoGhLeKGg7K27Ut3BY-xqDiuSAJAO1jiKm4gEt2MCmdeVMA&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=8.86">00:08</a>	Hello, I'm Harry Erba from Duke University. Welcome to this program entitled Progress in Practice: Planning New Pathways of Care in FLT3 positive AML. In this program, I will summarize key clinical information presented by me and my colleagues, Jessica Altman, [Felipe Russolo 00:00:28], and Richard Schlenk at a live symposium in Amsterdam. Additional resources from the symposium including the audio and slides from the full symposium are also available in association with this summary at medscape.org.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=uyctoZ2mXG9rY6QzAeKS_8Bu5advg7Wss-A_cJcl6LMWBPET1Q3qrcAhAjTUw2P0kidpoyEOorcK8aGNGI1wqoMXv2s&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=46">00:46</a>	Let's begin. There are three types of mutations that are found in FLT3 in AML. The most common is an internal tandem duplication or ITD found in about 20 to 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. This insertion disrupts the auto inhibitory function of the juxtamembrane region. The receptor is still dependent on the presence of FLT ligand for complete activation. In about five to 10% of patients, there's a point mutation leading to a missense in the tyrosine kinase domain. This also activates FLT3.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=vv1RVCnT0hdhM1LwQalq3hB6YEW4NpVACcy53Je8AV2Gv-fwFigJeON7LTq141n7n5wU9wUbXCts_axrz2VHF7RmSCo&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=83.21">01:23</a>	Rarely, point mutations in the juxtamembrane domain can be found. What these mutations all have in common is that they lead to ligand independent receptor dimerization and constitutive FLT3 signaling. Now it must be remembered that the FLT3 mutation is found along with many other mutations. In fact, the medium number of mutations in an AML sample is approximately four. On the slide you can see the complexity of the genomic landscape from a sample of 1,540 intensively treated patients.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=XsyqxW48m0Z1r8Qg6_UVn3FcVc2ufiKaMquXtFbl6va62WwoOmYTIMmkvLmB4GYHxGrtY7hYXLmdKnGiPkmMMXxRezc&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=122.14">02:02</a>	Now the FLT3 gene was the most frequently mutated, being found in 31% of patients. But as you can see from this, it is often found associated with other mutations. The FLT3 mutation is actually a late event in leukemogenesis. One way of assessing this fact is by looking at the allelic frequencies of all of the gene mutations that are found in acute myeloid leukemia as shown on this slide. Genes with mutations at a lower allelic frequency suggests that these mutations are occurring only in a subpopulation of leukemic blasts.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=3pGDPs076cZ2CYiY1X2btuMgzFp8spuUe-i054lfv3ddZHh4SCu6nvKZMSf5LgrqK3QHl3MFzBlnT5P3jMNl-8KozL0&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=160.7">02:40</a>	Five of the six genes with the lowest median variant allele frequency are all involved in growth factor signaling, including FLT3. Alterations in these pathways are often acquired relatively late during the evolution of the leukemic clone. We have learned over the years that the presence of a FLT3 ITD mutation is prognostically important. The prognostic importance of a FLT3 TKD mutation is much more debatable. However, in this data set from the United Kingdom, you could see that FLT3 ITD mutations occurred in about 25% of the non APL, AML patients. The presence or the absence of a FLT3 ITD did not appear to affect the complete remission rate. However, patients with a FLT3 ITD insertion mutation had a higher chance of relapsing and a lower overall survival. The prognosis for patients with FLT3 ITD remains poor even following allogeneic [inaudible 00:03:48] stem cell transplant due to the higher risk of relapse as shown here.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=KymEhuEN1lQQiVkVA7-5a0CR0QSB5hMH2Cl7EzuzjXG9LwxucEEQDBp_PZ8oxerRUcXiqzVcDnd3o1hf34tsU6zXcEM&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=235.4">03:55</a>	We have learned much about nuances in the FLT3 ITD and how it may affect prognosis. For example, the exact location of the insertion site as well as the length may be very important in determining the prognostic effect of a FLT3 ITD. In this dataset, you can see the positions of the internal tandem duplication being anywhere from the juxtamembrane domain region, but all the way into the tyrosine kinase domain region as well, and of course they vary in length.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=Fa7PA5gvGRrnrWyFxcYUQEpthDQPfaGz0H080a7a9D6h_EDUkW4tyIHyL7l3EZzEHbfh5PpusLqeSa6lYXRAUV_TcaY&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=266.47">04:26</a>	The importance of this observation is that insertion sites within the Beta of one sheet had a much worse prognosis or negative impact on prognosis than all other insertion sites. Now, this data on the position of the insertion can only be obtained through next-gen sequencing, not through PCR analysis. However, on the other hand, PCR analysis gives you a much more rapid turnaround time of the presence of a FLT3 ITD and actually much more reliably can detect the FLT3 ITD, which can sometimes be missed in an evaluation or analysis of next-gen sequencing data.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=oHXR8nWHOFf0EaOK414mvc4F8xFl6EQjzhR9B_TUi-I9EAick_TE5Ji3G0zVboDitu3Dfl97zOqJ-QfLrRgeHVCMwyo&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=309.08">05:09</a>	Not only is the position and the length of the ITD important, but also the mutant to wild type ratio or the allelic burden of the FLT3 ITD has been shown to impact response to induction therapy and overall survival. In this analysis of clinical trial data from Germany patients were divided into core tiles based on the FLT3 ITD mutant to wild type ratio. As you could see, patients with the highest mutant to wild type ratio had the lowest complete remission rate as well as the higher rate of resistant disease. The allele ratio, using a cutoff of 0.51, also segregated patients into a better or worse survival and relapse free survival following consolidation with chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=nws00esCsajaiUG8Wmnfu8kOpcNe8J8O0TUNJECiuJSVApQ4oOM0_2XDHDroTGvAESOSY70j5UWSEKjF1Ngy31D0zYo&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=371.56">06:11</a>	And in fact, the mutant to wild type ratio also impacts outcomes following allogeneic stem cell transplants performed in first complete remission as shown here. On the left, patients with a low mutant to wild type ratio below a cutoff of 0.51 did not appear to benefit from allogeneic stem cell transplant in first remission. However, patients with a higher mutant to wild type allelic ratio clearly had a benefit of allogeneic stem cell transplant in first remission compared to those who did not. A similar result was seen with a slightly different cutoff value in a different dataset published by Professor [Proto Kaurna 00:06:54].</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=rXhjmXPNkPRQfYfPZNzvZ8O4iw3SiStrFVcMA_4GdzPHsNjA9uLh_pAFdjJkYuCy5Ii2BfhuBn5bbrMxhaMNOtsknto&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=413.72">06:53</a>	The difficulty and challenge remains in where we should draw the cutoff. The distribution of FLT3 ITD to FLT3 wild type allelic ratio varies widely between studies, partly due to differences in the technique that is employed to measure this. Nevertheless, multiple studies have shown inferior overall survival and events free survival in patients with allelic ratios greater than the cutoff. The lack of consensus regarding this allelic ratio really is in regards to the most clinically relevant cutoff between high and low.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=df7TomzjINudmB75gZbE9Xze2yaDu1z0Y8R19iu3zeTT9Xfo6OoakCT2PsG3EP09W532G7hMl6jiosmULrpS4pB12ws&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=456.33">07:36</a>	Now that we have reviewed the prognostic importance of mutations in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase, let's move on to a discussion of the targeted agents that have been in development that inhibit FLT3. First I'm going to categorize the types of FLT3 inhibitors. There are first and second generation FLT3 inhibitors. Basically, first-generation FLT3 inhibitors are much less selective and can inhibit a broad range of a tyrosine and even serine-threonine kinases. Second Generation FLT3 inhibitors are more selective. However, none are perfectly selective, also inhibiting other kinases.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=fyNdNZqxPHv902ml5kXFEehdEEuZ1H1SUj8NeNh7uMsb0CyDXeyNUpHlvfAE_TfYWzOw1VqFNKNCpMaIVzkJr4iLI6U&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=502.54">08:22</a>	An example of first generation drugs are midostaurin and sorafenib. Examples of second generation drugs that we will discuss are gilteritinib, quizartinib, and crenolanib. The FLT3 inhibitors are also classified by mechanism of action. Type one inhibitors are drugs that are competitive inhibitors at the ATP binding site of the tyrosine kinase. Examples of type one inhibitors are midostaurin and quizartinib. Type one inhibitors are able inhibit activating mutations in FLT3 due to internal tandem duplication and tyrosine kinase domain. However, type two inhibitors actually maintain the inactive confirmation of FLT3 and because the tyrosine kinase domain mutation leads to the enzyme adopting the active conformation, type two inhibitors are not active against FLT3 with a tyrosine kinase domain mutation.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=wS4Wh4HM8tPECL-9smvofBZJIrMdtxvG3HK2SeNeJ-rCTabN4pATIArAKt_pyfyVImepoSGxNu5x9Ecp7nUW-jRM-JQ&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=566.04">09:26</a>	However, because the tyrosine kinase domain mutations forces the FLT3 to adopt an active confirmation, type two inhibitors will not be active against FLT3 TKD mutant. Examples of type two inhibitors are sorafenib and quizartinib. Type one include midostaurin and gilteritinib. Midostaurin has become very rapidly the new standard of care for the newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated AML based on the results of the RATIFY study, as well as the AML Study Group 16-10 study. The RATIFY trial was an international clinical trial where 717 patients were randomized between chemotherapy, with seven and three adopting daunorubicin and at 60 milligrams per meter squared followed by two weeks of midostaurin or placebo. Patients could then go on to receive up to four cycles of high dose cytarabine at three grams per meter squared per dose with midostaurin for two weeks in sequence or placebo. And then finally, patients could maintain the randomization and receive midostaurin or placebo continuously for 12 months.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=ULZFnej3zAKG2KQnlAU8Vmv8xFQe64IXqA6A72gl2lgn1DMOkDzBNsmbPibzg9P1qYRRMWeP9-JK9A-SaRIo867zhjo&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=647.13">10:47</a>	There was no significant difference in the complete remission rate between those patients treated with midostaurin and those with placebo, 58.9% versus 53.5%. However, the median overall survival was significantly longer in patients receiving midostaurin than placebo, almost 75 months versus 26 months. Now this median survival is really hard to judge because these curves plateau at around 50%. I think another way of looking at this data is looking at survival at four years where it was 51% of patients on the midostaurin arm were still alive versus 44% on the placebo arm. 182 patients under one stem cell transplant in first remission, the overall survival following transplant was 59% versus 55%. However, in a landmark analysis, it was shown that patients who received midostaurin to achieve first remission and then went on to allo transplant had a superior survival than those who received placebo with chemotherapy and then went on to allogeneic stem cell transplant in first remission.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=34GPHSH7R_yKUj37_s3GdzM9K7XfobD8iMQ-9FJp7ZeHXpwQGWCDtkDsh3_qBxHzIsN2LnHi4eDTR6UJ08MbWJiVHkk&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=719.2">11:59</a>	In the subset analysis, the benefit of midostaurin was seen based on the stratification of high versus low allelic burden of ITD as well as in the TKD variants. Midostaurin was also evaluated in newly diagnosed FLT3 ITD mutated AML patients in the AML Study Group 16-10 study from Germany. This has been recently published. This was not a randomized trial. Patients received induction chemotherapy followed by midostaurin and midostaurin was continued for longer than two weeks, right up until consolidation. And then consolidation with high dose [inaudible 00:12:42] with a dose dependent on age of patients again with midostaurin in sequence and continuing until maintenance, which went on for one year. And of course, like in the RATIFY trial, patients were encouraged to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=wMbm54R8TSwaXCvClYwwmi6Ghck2IJZNtW62suMO6xi50vDErU3F8Cbcb_IoGhV8GGznaETcyggn_Vw4Nzg17gJdvMk&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=782.61">13:02</a>	There was no difference in the complete remission rate or CRI rate between younger and older patients being about 76%. The event free survival at two years was 39% in younger patients and 34% in the older patients. And two years overall survival, 53% in younger and 46% in older. But what was done in this analysis is that patients in the trial were matched with historical controls and what is shown here is that the event free survival for both younger and older patients was superior in the current trial of 16-10 where patients received midostaurin with chemotherapy followed by a maintenance compared to the historical controls that did not receive midostaurin.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=fAYKmI1-be0BD1mVbtFj2TPuT8mPXQTXTKSmvvH3e3dFXBN4KEs0UJXr69-szVPkhLKc-eJDyJb0r7ZlP-R_QnUVnXE&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=828.56">13:48</a>	In terms of toxicity, there was more toxicity and older versus younger patients including a higher rate of arrhythmias in the older patients. The median duration of maintenance was nine months. Now, during induction and consolidation with chemotherapy, there was a higher rate of anemia with midostaurin compared to placebo. However, there was no prolongation of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. In terms of non-hematologic toxicity, there was a higher rate of rash both grade three and four in patients receiving midostaurin compared with placebo. However, there was no difference in the risk of infections. During maintenance, there was GI toxicity and some risk of infection observed and, as mentioned in older patients, a higher risk of cardiac events including arrhythmias.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iqkL9IuSESJLkO2cnQnL3yxbZJ66g6G9sM9iWfzH-W2avz5Wy0ZEEZM1tI2FSoyqLm9UXNWauYyqTCPmV9LUxZ84_Yc&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=878.27">14:38</a>	Sorafenib is another first generation FLT3 inhibitor. However, this is a type two inhibitor, again, only inhibiting the FLT3 ITD. In the SOAR AML trial, AML patients were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy followed by sorafenib or chemotherapy followed by placebo. All patients were eligible regardless of FLT3 mutation status. Only about 10% of patients in each arm had the FLT3 ITD. There was no difference in the complete remission rate between sorafenib and placebo, 60 versus 59%. However, for the entire group of patients, the event free survival was superior and relapse free survival, superior with sorafenib compared to placebo. This did not translate into a survival benefit. And in the small subset of patients who had the FLT3 ITD, there was no obvious difference in relapse free survival. Sorafenib is associated with fever, diarrheas bleeding, and cardiac events, hand, foot, skin reactions, and rash.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=a7CmGbBsq_Ph1qGQNRSEfE5MIDv-cruJPKwfIn_7gPNBUWArgKrZjoN3_voEAJXMii-W42vgYr0TJ5J6LWWVHt-pmSk&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=949.06">15:49</a>	There are now a number of first line clinical trials evaluating the use of second generation FLT3 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy for FLT3 mutated patients. QuANTUM-First is a phase three study of quizartinib versus placebo in a newly diagnosed patients up to the age of 75. And this study opened in September 2016 and is rapidly meeting its accrue goal. Crenolanib, another a second generation type one inhibitor, is being [inaudible 00:16:20] to midostaurin in combination with Dawn Reuben's cytarabine at a dose of 90 milligrams per meter squared of the daunorubicin following induction chemotherapy and as well following consolidation. And finally gilteritinib is being compared to midostaurin in phase two and phase three studies in newly diagnosed patients.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=3RGRQ7N0V09Cp34yyI7HnAvtXExDtkPV-nbfhz9m80mWaxuP3iMpSDYCAciH8C-zGn0__XHQrCPl_2XFfAOw5skmAbs&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1003.1">16:43</a>	FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors have also been used in combination with hypomethylating agents. It is known that chemotherapy, especially intensive chemotherapy can induce high levels of FLT3 ligand ,which can then compete with the FLT3 inhibitor for effect, but this doesn't occur with the HMAs. There are a number of key phase one and two trials that have been reported using sorafenib, midostaurin, and quizartinib in combination with low dose or low intensity chemotherapies.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iBKNrbol3WdUlVQpTosGR1ebqDZU18zf1AEe227TSJvCxDHPrbP3eMfl9Q40LAPRpguTlZ_3AdCslKloUQrOBybsyLg&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1038.66">17:18</a>	So the potential options for FLT3 inhibition and frontline therapy today are summarized here. In younger fit patients, three and seven, chemotherapy, followed by two weeks of midostaurin, consolidation with high dose CRC with midostaurin is approved in both the United States and in Europe. In Europe, maintenances also have been improved based on results of the RATIFY trial, but not so in the United States. It is recommended that if the patient is eligible, even if they've received midostaurin, they should undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant in first remission. For older patients, off Label use of these kinase inhibitors alone or with hypomethylating agents or preferably on clinical trial should be considered.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=5dtem_sa-0BcJz-TxC8rdvqMluz-PlMmSlOfebZrrrJCO2rrCEw6T29jeM1V7jWhSqp99KXlwEZ1WEaqK6ZmyuhNQ0I&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1087.35">18:07</a>	Now, FLT3 inhibitors have also been considered for maintenance therapy. As mentioned in the RATIFY trial, patients maintained the randomization to receive either midostaurin for one year or placebo. There was no difference in disease free survival at the end of that one year of maintenance therapy. However, it should be noted that after that one year of maintenance when midostaurin placebo were discontinued, there was a very rapid decrease in disease free survival in the midostaurin arm by about 20 to 25% suggesting that there may have been some benefit. Midostaurin has also been evaluated in the AMLSG 16-10 study as a post allogeneic stem cell transplant maintenance.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=Tdt6oXkkPomU-ISGce65kwNZDZUfHJbeokRT_R9QoTosWFFP2UG_rAxLI6bflnpAQdWFcadFK12kCQM3zvkRFqbl3qE&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1134.19">18:54</a>	Now, in this study that I've already mentioned, there was no randomization between maintenance or no maintenance, but if patients received midostaurin maintenance, they had a superior event free survival and overall survival following allogeneic transplant than if they did not. The difficulty, of course, post transplant, is the toxicity with 70% risk of GI toxicity, 51% risk of infections and cytopenias also being seen.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=gCytdL6yP60YwGtiVEpmYBITkvt6bNHilduK_bjZfingyyjtgGNOz8QeJlVfUNL4HYweVLnQ9VmOCVDkrPQEXktSYHY&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1161.69">19:21</a>	Finally, the SOAR maned on trial was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in 2018. This is a German trial that looked at a sorafenib versus placebo beginning one to three months post allogeneic transplant in AML patients with a FLT3 ITD mutation. The sorafenib was continued for 24 months. At two years, there was a difference in relapse free survival favoring sorafenib. There was no a large difference in the rate of graft versus host disease, although it was slightly higher with sorafenib at 24% versus 18% with placebo.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=oXz36nlIhTegnk2lXMS4Dev3_QufZ1FHeG13zpIxzWfG76KcFp679WK9oje6cFMxN98eBYeMRy-lCFPJqHoDWtNaaAw&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1202.21">20:02</a>	Let me now move on to the use of FLT3 inhibitors in the relapse, refractory setting. Gilteritinib has now been approved in the United States for patients with FLT3 mutated relapsed, refractory AML based on the results of the admiral global randomized phase three study. In this trial, patients with relapse refractory AML FLT3 mutated either ITD or TKD mutation. After first line therapy including allogeneic transplant, were randomized two to one between gilteritinib 120 milligrams daily continuously versus salvage chemotherapy, a choice of two different intensive chemo regimens or two less intensive chemotherapy regimens. Stem cell transplant was recommended and post transplant if patients were assigned to gilteritinib, they can continue.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=62O9t_WJhVL4CWtFQA_qoSePJei5HThm0RXxNoTFN6u0ZZswhZByNJnYoaJkI2_MSdfeQ3O4MY9XYmEX-s3TZ7vUhwc&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1251.94">20:51</a>	The CR rate was higher with gilteritinib, 21 versus 11% CRH, which I believe is an important, response with platelets above 50,000 and ANC above 500 both was in 13% versus 5%. So the CRC rate was a 54% with gilteritinib and 22% with chemotherapy. The median exposure to drug was longer with a gilteritinib. The time to CRC was 1.8 months with gilteritinib. And the duration of response to the median was 11 months. Importantly, 26% of patients could then be bridged to allogeneic transplant after gilteritinib versus only 15% with chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study was met with an improvement in median survival from 5.6 months with salvage chemotherapy to 9.3 months with gilteritinib. At one year, 37% of patients randomly assigned to gilteritinib were still alive versus 17% with chemotherapy. However, it must be noted that by 24 months, the outcomes of these patients was dismal with less than 20% of patients still alive.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=nToZ2-TeKfOA880w8IqJK2nqJGQcPF3Q5Q8Lt4oXSddQtWvC3aXyd8QY7OiiQQCN6b70z0p19f4ZAFt0XLdtnQqfh3s&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1322.71">22:02</a>	It does appear though that continuing gilteritinib as a maintenance post-transplant may be important as shown here, where patients who resume gilteritinib had a higher overall survival post allo transplant than those who did not. Of course, the confounding factor are the factors that go into the decision about continuing gilteritinib or not. Nonetheless, it does appear to be a benefit in patients who can tolerate gilteritinib.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=ynzLIZS7GhHa2OQkFTA8Ptnqy2tEEruwCQeTc32Ib0zdUVGQrJfHmyau34WUKggoXcIcPXmUlgG1UFe7VYgeKj_o2U0&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1349.77">22:29</a>	Quizartinib was assessed in a similarly designed study in the relapsed, refractory setting. In this study, patients had either refractory AML or must have relapsed within six months of first remission, so very high risk patients. They were randomized between quizartinib with a startup dose to assess for QT prolongation and then increased by day 16 if tolerated versus salvage chemotherapy. Again, most of the patients receiving intensive chemotherapy with mek or flag patients were encouraged to undergo stem cell transplant and can continue quizartinib. This study also met its primary endpoint with improvement in median survival from 4.7 months with chemotherapy to 6.2 months with quizartinib. Event free survival was not statistically different. However, patients who achieved a CRI were considered an event in this trial. The CRC rate was almost double in the quizartinib arm, 48% versus 27% with salvage chemotherapy.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=oVu5Fb35ga_kYksKXVeqQv3Oe0DHCzXFU2NpfqCIf5tzGWuaGTXzTqdGsPdRctpI18D38-FDWYO3ygPb9H7kWNA7cbQ&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1420.43">23:40</a>	And importantly, 32% of patients randomized to quizartinib could undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant in remission compared to only 11%. And as you can see here that patients who achieved a remission with either chemotherapy or quizartinib did undergo transplant in both arms. It was 67% of all patients in first response with quizartinib and 64% of patients in a response after salvage chemotherapy. Now, one way of differentiating these agents is by the toxicity profiles, which are here. I've already discussed midostaurin and sorafenib. In terms of quizartinib, especially in the phase one studies, there was a signal for prolongation of QT, especially at higher doses, and a differential between men and women. However, in the doses employed in the QuANTUM-R study, only 3% of patients had a QTC over 500 milliseconds. There is more a parent mild suppression due to inhibition of c-KIT with quizartinib than is recognized with gilteritinib. Nonetheless, that is a toxicity as well with gilteritinib as is liver toxicity, some GI toxicity, and risk of infections, and recently a warning about differentiation syndrome with gilteritinib.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=TCeplPegjfJAkn5EvqzdwlvvfYllYgig8jllE-qoSrKkSIDXp1fV8XVl5RmZw4P_DsuTixwwk-wft8wYbgT1M_s2RWM&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1499.48">24:59</a>	So at this point, gilteritinib is the only drug that is approved for relapsed, refractory FLT3 mutated AML. And there is no comparative data between the FLT3 inhibitors, either first generation with second generation or among the second generation drugs. So we anticipate choosing based on prior exposures to FLT3 inhibitors as well as the toxicity profiles common at medications, ability to get patients to transplant, and longterm goals. Is it palliation or as it curative intent to transplant? And hopefully in the near future we will have multiple agents to choose from for our patients with FLT3 mutated AML in relapsed or refractory disease.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=zfVYRO0Nc6TJuLwyYQIOtnbkmdiQFNttIole2de2KKIb4g2CeVFk0zAPDgf0flu6iWXNEZpiRdSlT7sAHgYWr_y0AGg&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1547.2">25:47</a>	So the key takeaway points from our presentation in Amsterdam is that the RATIFY and AML Study Group 16-10 studies have led to a new standard of care for treatment naive FLT3 mutated AML patients. It should be stressed, however, that although the addition of midostaurin does improve the overall survival, we still encourage patients to be considered for allogeneic stem cell transplant in first remission following a midostaurin containing chemotherapy. However, there are still a number of ongoing questions. First of all, the absolute benefit in improvement in survival at four years in the RATIFY trial was significant, but minimal, from 44% to 51% leading some people to question whether a more potent second generation inhibitor may actually be better to use as part of initial therapy than a first generation drug.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=orZwJfywOhYmsA3MQ_Z9Ehll1M25U7pvCh41An38GCqE3PtC5EfPeOujvGJLicWcpGaDL-6GuAJ6FPLFIQODiMjDx20&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1606.16">26:46</a>	These clinical trials, as mentioned, are in progress. I would warn listeners not to generalize from preclinical data on potency of drugs to the benefit in a clinical trial or a clinical setting. And in fact, it may be that first generation drugs such as midostaurin, sorafenib do show a benefit because they don't just inhibit FLT3, but actually are much more broadly targeted. And so I would encourage listeners not to substitute second generation drugs for the first generation midostaurin, which has been approved in the setting based on the RATIFY trial.</p>

<p>Harry Erba:	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=Ps0-bSkZRAzboXwecSL-qH288fRQ8j71ZessEBs46GiAU5r3nrY9XWcdfimbfm_VDYy0_TklwO-8zZ1d5ZqWocvvQQY&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=1647.64">27:27</a>	But, of course, I think we can improve on the chemotherapy backbone that we use with the FLT3 inhibitors. Higher doses of daunorubicin, 90 versus 45 or 60, have been shown to be a benefit in FLT3 mutated patients. And there appears to be a benefit of the addition of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in FLT3 mutated patients or in the use of the liposomal daunorubicin in Cytarabine in secondary AML patients with a FLT3 mutation. And of course combinations with FLT3 inhibitors must be performed. And we have to look at combination with other targeted therapies such as IDH mutant inhibitors. And then, finally, I don't really believe that we are satisfied with the longterm outcome of our patients with relapsed, refractory disease in both QuANTUM-R and in the admiral trial. The survival at two years was less than 20%. I believe there will be combinations of these drugs with other targeted therapies and still with chemotherapy in an attempt to improve outcomes for patients with FLT3 mutated AML. So thank you for participating in this activity. Please continue on to answer the questions that follow and complete the evaluation.</p>
