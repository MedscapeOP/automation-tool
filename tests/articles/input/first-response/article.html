<a name="Heading242"></a><strong>Questions (Evaluations, Assessments, and Posttests)</strong></h1>
<p><em>Place <strong>CME posttest and </strong></em><strong><em>pre-assessment/post-assessment question pairs</em> &#953;</strong><em> in this section. Click </em><strong>+</strong><em> to add additional question building blocks as needed. Adhere to character <strong>limits</strong>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Question type:</strong> CME Posttest</p>

<p><strong>Question Introduction (</strong><strong>optional &#953;):</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Which of the following best describes the burden of migraine on career, finances, and relationships?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The impact on relationships is similar among those with chronic migraine (CM) and those with episodic migraine (EM)</p>

<p>&#8226;	The impact on partner career is minimal and independent of whether CM or EM is present</p>

<p>&#8226;	The impact on personal and partner career and finances, as well as on relationships, is substantial and is greater in those with CM vs EM</p>

<p>&#8226;	The impact on personal career and finances, as well as on relationships, is moderate, and does not affect overall health and well-being</p>

<p>Answer explanation: Data from the Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes (CaMEO) study show a consistent belief among patients with migraine that it has a detrimental effect on many aspects of life, including relationships, family life, career, finances, and overall health. Across all domains, those with CM were 2 to 3 times more likely to express negative effects due to migraine vs those with EM. Among those with EM, the extent to which headaches were perceived to be a problem increased with headache day frequency.</p>

<p><strong>Question type:</strong> CME Posttest</p>

<p><strong>Question Introduction (</strong><strong>optional &#953;):</strong> A 32-year-old man with CM is treated with the CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) monoclonal antibody (mAb) fremanezumab.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Based on clinical trial data, which of following is the most likely outcome?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Reduction in headache and migraine days per month and possible reversion to EM</p>

<p>&#8226;	Reduction in headache days per month and reduction in impaired functioning on preheadache days</p>

<p>&#8226;	Reduction in migraine days per month and reduction in cardiovascular comorbidities</p>

<p>&#8226;	Reduction in headache and migraine days per month, improved functioning on pre- and postheadache days, and improved comorbidity profiles</p>

<p>Answer explanation: Results of the HALO-CM trial of fremanezumab as preventive therapy in patients with CM show significantly reduced frequency of headache and migraine days vs placebo. One-third of patients also reverted to EM. Tools currently used in clinical trials measure the effect of CM on function only during headache days, not before or after. Comorbidity profiles can be used to describe the natural history of migraine; they are not used as treatment outcome measures.</p>

<p><strong>Question type:</strong> CME Posttest</p>

<p><strong>Question Introduction (</strong><strong>optional &#953;):</strong> A 41-year-old woman with chronic CM reports 21 headache days per month and frequent use of acute headache medication despite previous treatment with 2 preventive therapies.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Based on clinical trial data, which of the following might be expected from treatment with a CGRP-targeting mAb?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Minimal response because of the frequency of her headache days</p>

<p>&#8226;	Minimal response because of her history of medication overuse</p>

<p>&#8226;	Good response, with a rapid decrease in frequency of headache days</p>

<p>&#8226;	Minimal response because of previous failure of 2 preventive therapies to relieve her migraine</p>

<p>Answer explanation: Studies with the CGRP-targeting mAbs erenumab, fremanezumab, eptinezumab, and galcanezumab used as preventive therapy in patients with CM show an early rapid decrease in frequency of headache days, even in patients who failed multiple prior preventive therapies and those with medication overuse. </p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>After a year, only 15% remain on treatment</p>

<p>&#8226;	If ask people why they discontinue, they give 2 major reasons independent of what class of medication they are on</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>The medicine does not work well enough</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>The medicine causes too many side effects</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Weighing Treatment Efficacy and Tolerability</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	When thinking about whether to continue a patient on preventive treatment, look at 2 &#215; 2 table of efficacy vs side effects</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>In cell A, the treatment is working, does not produce side effects</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Very likely the treatment that should be continued</p>

<p>&#8226;	In cell D, the treatment is not effective and produces side effects</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Very little chance patients will continue treatment and clinicians also unlikely to continue</p>

<p>&#8226;	Cell C is the most common situation with oral generic preventive medications for migraine</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Medication is at least somewhat effective but also producing side effects</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Patients and clinicians have a difficult choice to make</p>

<p>&#8226;	Emerging monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for migraine are particularly attractive</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>They provide efficacy with little in the way of penalty in terms of adverse events</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Much greater chance of keeping people in cell A</p>

<p>&#8226;	Study identifying natural subgroups of migraine to address questions</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Why is migraine so common?</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Why do the clinical features of migraine vary so much from person to person?</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Why is treatment response so variable?</p>

<p>&#9642;	Why does one person respond to a tricyclic antidepressant, another to a beta-blocker, and another to an antiepilepsy drug?</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Why has it been so difficult to identify genes for migraine?</p>

<p>&#9642;	Identified genes for rare forms of migraine like familial hemiplegic migraine</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Most of genetic determinants of more common forms of migraine remain to be identified</p>

<p>&#8226;	Solution is to do a better job of characterizing natural subgroups of people with migraine</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>One approach is to use comorbidity profiles</p>

<p>&#9642;	Use conditions that travel along with migraine to identify natural subgroups of migraine</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Lasmiditan for Acute Treatment of Migraine</strong><sup><strong>[11,12]</strong></sup></p>

<p>&#8226;	Two recent updates in acute treatment of migraine</p>

<p>&#8226;	New 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonist lasmiditan</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Built on the platform of triptans, which are 5-HT<sub>1B, 1D</sub>, and to some extent, 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonists</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Because of the 1D receptor agonism, triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease</p>

<p>&#8226;	Lasmiditan removed the 1B and the 1D agonism and just left the 1F receptor agonism</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>1F receptors are not located on blood vessels, so there is no cardiovascular liability associated with this medication</p>

<p>&#8226;	Results of 2 large studies reported: SAMURAI and SPARTAN</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Both large, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies evaluating efficacy and safety of lasmiditan for acute treatment of migraine</p>

<p>&#8226;	Primary endpoint was percentage of patients pain free at 2 hours and percentage of patients free of their most bothersome symptom at 2 hours</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>In both studies, 28% to 38% of patients were pain free at 2 hours</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>About two-thirds had relief of headache in 2 hours</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>More than 40% had relief of the most bothersome symptom</p>

<p>&#8226;	Both studies showed that all 3 doses tested -- 50, 100, 200 mg -- were all highly statistically superior to placebo</p>

<p>&#8226;	No serious safety signals </p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Dizziness the most common adverse event, reported in about 16% to 18% of patients</p>

<p>&#8226;	Lasmiditan, if approved, will provide an option for patients for whom triptans are contraindicated</p>

<p>&#8226;	Like lasmiditan, CGRP receptor antagonists do not constrict blood vessels</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Should have no contraindication for patients with established cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease</p>
