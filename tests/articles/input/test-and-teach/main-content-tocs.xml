                <p>The following cases are modeled on the interactive grand rounds approach. The questions within the activity are designed to test your current knowledge. After each question, you will be able to see whether you answered correctly and read evidence-based information that supports the most appropriate answer choice. The questions are designed to challenge you; you will not be penalized for answering the questions incorrectly. At the end of the activity, there will be a short post-test assessment based on the material presented.</p>

                <p style="min-height: 230px;">Jason is a 37-year-old male with progressively worsening lower back pain. Thinking back, Jason remembers that even in his late teens he had some sporadic back pain. He first sought treatment for his back pain at the age of 25. There was no injury or identifiable factor or event associated with the pain. At that time, he began treatment with ibuprofen 400 mg taken every 6 hours. This provided him with significant symptom relief. However, after about 5 years, he developed intolerable gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. He switched to naproxen 220 mg BID. This provided relief for a time, but now he reports that it does not adequately control his pain. Jason says that his back pain is worse in the morning and is somewhat relieved after he gets up and moves around. In addition, he says that the pain often disrupts his sleep about 3 or 4 hours into the night. He has sought chiropractic treatment as well as physical therapy for the back pain, but neither resulted in lasting symptom relief (Tables 1 and 2).</p>

                <p>Spondyloarthritis (SpA) describes a collection of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases that have overlapping features, including axial and peripheral joint involvement such as sacroiliitis, enthesitis, peripheral inflammatory arthritis, extra-articular manifestations, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positivity, and familial aggregation.
                    <sup type="ref">[1,2]</sup> Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is characterized by involvement of the sacroiliac joints and spine. The diagnosis of axSpA is often delayed, sometimes by as much as 8 years or more.
                    <sup type="ref">[3]</sup> A chief reason for the long diagnostic delay is that sacroiliitis, which is considered a hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), is not clinically detectable and may not be visible on plain x-ray in the early stages of the disease.
                    <sup type="ref">[4]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>There are 2 main types of SpA, axial and peripheral, depending upon the main presenting symptoms. However, the 2 types can overlap, and one may progress to the other. Axial SpA predominantly involves the spine and sacroiliac joints. Peripheral SpA predominantly involves peripheral joints. For classification purposes, axSpA is further divided into radiographic or nonradiographic (Figure 1).

                <p>An evolving understanding of the concept of axSpA has led to a differentiation between nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) and radiographic axSpA. These 2 terms are distinguished by the degree of sacroiliitis assessed by conventional radiography. Radiographic axSpA, or AS, can be diagnosed only when there is definitive evidence of sacroiliitis on plain radiographs of the sacroiliac.
                    <sup type="ref">[2]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>In clinical practice, it is important to remember that radiographic sacroiliitis is a late finding in the disease course of many patients.
                    <sup type="ref">[5]</sup> Patients can be diagnosed based on a typical clinical pattern, even in the presence of normal radiographs. The leading symptom of axSpA is chronic back pain, which is "inflammatory" in nature, improves with physical activity, and is not relieved by rest. In addition, other musculoskeletal manifestations of axSpA include arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis.
                    <sup type="ref">[5]</sup> Certain typical extra-articular manifestations in a patient should raise the clinical suspicion of axSpA. These can include acute anterior uveitis (AAU), psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
                    <sup type="ref">[5]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>In Jason's case, he has had 3 occurrences of uveitis, which is a common finding in patients with axSpA. In one cross-sectional study of patients with AS, 39% had a history of AAU.
                    <sup type="ref">[6]</sup> In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of AAU was 25.8%.
                    <sup type="ref">[7]</sup> A study of unselected patients presenting with uveitis identified a minimum prevalence of axSpA of 20.2%. Of those patients, 22.9% did not have a previous diagnosis of axSpA.
                    <sup type="ref">[8]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>Crucial elements for a prompt and accurate diagnosis include a comprehensive history of the presenting complaint and past medical history. A timeline of the pain and description of aggravating factors provide clues to the diagnosis. Patients with axSpA typically describe a pattern of pronounced stiffness and improvement of pain and stiffness with activity or exercise.

                <p>MRI may show signs of inflammation much earlier than radiographs show structural damage. MRI allows early detection of sacroiliac joint inflammation in patients with axSpA.
                    <sup type="ref">[9,10]</sup> A gadolinium-enhanced image can detect areas of increased vascularization, helping detect synovitis and enthesitis; however, it does not necessarily add value to the diagnostic capacity of the MRI over STIR or T1 sequences in diagnosing early axSpA.
                    <sup type="ref">[9]</sup> During the inflammatory phase, a STIR image will typically show hyperintensity in the bone marrow (termed "bone marrow edema") on both sides of the sacroiliac joints.
                    <sup type="ref">[11]</sup> As such, to save time and to reduce patient burden, cost, and risk, gadolinium administration is not needed.

                <p>MRI of the sacroiliac joints is obtained. The T1-weighted image shows some evidence of erosions and sclerosis, and the STIR image shows evidence of bone marrow edema at the inferior corner of the iliac and the sacral side of the joint.

                <p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first-line treatment for nr-axSpA. Although these are effective in reducing inflammation, pain, and stiffness, it is important to remember that they can be associated with GI bleeding and cardiotoxicity. For disease that is refractory to NSAIDs and for patients who cannot take NSAIDs, guidelines recommend that a biological medication should be used, such as a TNF inhibitor or an interleukin (IL) 17 inhibitor.
                    <sup type="ref">[1,5]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>At this time, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for nr-axSpA; however, treatment guidelines by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and also European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) do recommend the use of some treatments indicated for AS for patients with nr-axSpA.
                    <sup type="ref">[1,5]</sup> The 5 TNF inhibitors that have demonstrated efficacy for nr-AxSpA and are approved by the FDA to treat AS are
                    <sup type="ref">[1]</sup>:

                    <li>Infliximab</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Secukinumab is the first IL-17 inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of AS.
                    <sup type="ref">[12]</sup> Studies of IL-17 inhibitors in patients with nonradiographic disease are currently underway. Caution should be used when considering IL-17 inhibitors for patients with axSpA who have active IBD or Crohn disease.
                    <sup type="ref">[5]</sup> It should also be noted that both TNF inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors can reactivate latent tuberculosis and increase the risk for infection.
                    <sup type="ref">[1]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>ACR/SAA/SPARTAN strongly recommend against treatment with systemic glucocorticoids in active AS and active nr-axSpA.
                    <sup type="ref">[1]</sup> Limited studies have been done on the treatment of active AS with systemic glucocorticoids, showing modest improvements; however, the sample sizes of the randomized controlled trials (RCT) were small, and the quality of evidence for the case studies was considered low due to risk for bias and imprecision in the effect estimation.
                    <sup type="ref">[1,13-16]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>The treatment of patients with axSpA should be individualized according to the patient's current condition and disease severity, as well as patient characteristics such as comorbidities and psychosocial factors.
                    <sup type="ref">[1,5]</sup> AxSpA is associated with several comorbidities that contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality and add to the complexity of management. These comorbidities include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcers, headaches, depression, uveitis, cancer, IBD, osteoporosis, psoriasis, and other cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and neurological complications.
                    <sup type="ref">[6,17,18]</sup> Therefore, it is important to take any presenting comorbidities into account when creating treatment plans, and to refer patients to specialists in a timely manner.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to receiving pharmacologic therapy, patients should be advised to exercise on a regular basis. Home exercises should be recommended to Jason, as they have proven benefit for patients with axSpA.
                    <sup type="ref">[19]</sup> Physical therapy is more beneficial than home exercises, but it is more expensive and less feasible than home exercises.
                    <sup type="ref">[5,19]</sup> Physical therapy should be considered for each patient and the decision should be made on an individual basis.
                    <sup type="ref">[5]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>Patients should be educated about all aspects of managing their disease and be encouraged to share in decision-making about their treatment.
                    <sup type="ref">[1] </sup>Disease monitoring of patients with axSpA in the clinic could include assessment of disease activity, patient-reported outcomes, clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging. The types and frequency of monitoring should be decided on an individual basis depending on symptoms, severity, and treatment regimen.
                    <sup type="ref">[5] </sup>To define the level of disease activity, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) or the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) may be used.
                    <sup type="ref">[1,5,20,21]</sup> (Figures 2 and 3) In past clinical practice, active disease has been defined as BASDAI score ≥4, but active disease can also be defined as ASDAS ≥2.1.

                <p>It has been suggested that the ASDAS is a better measure of disease activity than the BASDAI.
                    <sup type="ref">[5,24]</sup> In support of this conclusion, the BASDAI is a fully patient-reported outcome measure, whereas the ASDAS is based on both patient reports and C-reactive protein.
                    <sup type="ref">[20,23]</sup> In addition, the ASDAS cut-offs for disease activity states and response criteria were based on a thorough validation process, while the BASDAI cut-offs were chosen arbitrarily. Furthermore, whereas persistently increased ASDAS is associated with syndesmophyte formation, the BASDAI must be combined with CRP measurement to have similar value.
                    <sup type="ref">[25]</sup> Although often there is concordance between BASDAI score ≥4 and ASDAS ≥2.1, in discordant cases, an elevated ASDAS is more predictive of good response than an elevated BASDAI.

                <p>Infusion reactions to infliximab can happen at any time during treatment, even in patients who have previously tolerated treatment.
                    <sup type="ref">[26]</sup> However, in a prospective analysis of patients enrolled in a community registry, infusion reactions to infliximab were uncommon and were typically classified as mild to moderate.
                    <sup type="ref">[27]</sup> Over the 7-year analysis of 1632 patients, 63.1% were treated for rheumatologic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, AS, or psoriatic arthritis. The most common infusion reactions were pruritus (19.9%), flushing (9.9%), and dyspnea (6.2%). About two-thirds of infusion reactions were observed during the first year of therapy.

                <p>Recent analyses and several guidelines recommend that switching TNF inhibitors can be beneficial in a number of patients with axSpA who have a secondary loss of response to initial TNF inhibitor therapy.
                    <sup type="ref">[1,5,28]</sup> In Europe, TNF inhibitors are indicated for axSpA, including nonradiographic disease, as long as there is evidence of active inflammation. In the United States, the indication is currently limited to AS.

                </p>
                <p>Adalimumab is currently indicated for AS and is recommended for nr-axSpA based on data from clinical trials.
                    <sup type="ref">[5]</sup> However, it is not a specifically approved indication in the United States.
                    <sup type="ref">[29]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>In the randomized, controlled ABILITY-1 trial, adalimumab had a positive benefit-risk profile in patients with active nr-axSpA.
                    <sup type="ref">[33]</sup> Greater improvements in disease activity, physical function, and health-related quality of life, as well as reduction of sacroiliac joint and spine inflammation, based on MRI findings were demonstrated after 12 weeks of adalimumab therapy compared with placebo (Table 3). In the open-label ABILITY-1 extension, patients with nr-axSpA had sustained clinical and functional improvements through 3 years, as well as suppression of MRI axial inflammation, which was greater in patients who achieved clinical remission.
                    <sup type="ref">[34]</sup> The safety profile was consistent with what has been observed with adalimumab in AS and other diseases.

                <p>There are several other TNF inhibitors that are currently approved for the indication of nr-axSpA in Europe and other countries, but not in the United States. These include certolizumab, etanercept, and golimumab. Data from several recent clinical trials have demonstrated good efficacy and safety profiles for these agents for nr-axSpA (Table 3).</p>

                <p style="min-height: 230px;">Laura is a 41-year-old woman who has been referred to rheumatology for chronic back pain. She presents today with a swollen R ankle. It was initially blamed on a fall when she was carrying a laundry basket up the stairs, but that injury occurred 3 weeks ago. She has treated the ankle with rest, ice, and elevation, but the symptoms have not improved. She reports that this is not the first time that she has had problems with pain and swelling in her right ankle. In fact, she says, it has been a problem on and off since she was 18 or 19 years old. Laura also has a history of progressively worsening back pain. She has had this back pain since the age of 23, first experiencing it after a caesarean section. An x-ray of the lumbar spine was done at age 26, and was normal; however, a repeat x-ray 1 year ago showed mild osteoarthritis in the lumbar region with degenerative disc disease at L5-S1. She reports that she has been doing physical therapy exercises for her back, which help with the pain (Tables 4 and 5).</p>

                <p>A contributor to the problem of delayed diagnosis of AS is difficulty in recognizing disease that is not specifically associated with radiographic findings.
                    <sup type="ref">[46]</sup> That is illustrated in this case. A synovial cell count of 14,000 suggests inflammatory arthritis, which should prompt a referral to a rheumatologist rather than to an orthopedic surgeon.
                    <sup type="ref">[47]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>Gender can be another factor in a long diagnostic delay of AS and is an important consideration in treatment. Data indicate that men with axSpA have a worse radiologic prognosis, whereas women have a higher disease burden, partly as a result of a longer delay in diagnosis, higher disease activity, and less responsiveness to treatment with TNF inhibitors.

                <p>TNF inhibition has been the therapy of choice for patients with established AS. There are 5 different TNF inhibitors currently approved for AS: adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab (Table 8). These agents have all demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of AS, but do differ in molecular structure and administration route.

                </p>
                <p>For adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, ACR/SAA/SPARTAN recommends a TNF inhibitor based on an analysis of 13 RCTs, which showed large and consistent improvements in clinical outcomes.
                    <sup type="ref">[1]</sup> However, the panel notes that the trials were short, with most limited to 24 weeks. The panel also emphasizes that the decision to begin treatment with a TNF inhibitor should be made only after educating the patient on the potential risks and benefits.

                <p>For patients with no significant comorbidities, there is probably no difference between adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, golimumab, and infliximab in terms of efficacy, though no head-to-head studies are available.

                <p>Current practice is that if a patient with AS is doing well on measures such as BASDAI, there is no need for combination therapy. The ACR/SAA/SPARTAN conditionally recommends continuing treatment with a TNF inhibitor alone in patients with stable AS on TNF inhibitor and NSAID combination therapy.
                    <sup type="ref">[1]</sup> Some data show that a combination of a TNF inhibitor and an NSAID might be better than monotherapy for reducing radiographic progression, but these data are still preliminary. The question is being explored in an ongoing trial.
                    <sup type="ref">[58]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>A recently reported prospective observational cohort study evaluated NSAID use in relation to disease activity during 52 weeks of follow-up in patients with established AS who were treated with or without TNF inhibitor.
                    <sup type="ref">[59]</sup> Patients who used TNF inhibitor therapy were advised that after 3 months of using the TNF inhibitor, they should start taking their NSAID only as needed. However, many patients reduced or stopped NSAID use on their own initiative even earlier. Overall, concomitant NSAID use in the TNF inhibitor group declined rapidly.
                </p>
                <p>It is important that patients who smoke be educated about the consequences of continuing to smoke and be counseled to stop. The available data indicate that smoking has a dose-dependent impact on progressive structural damage in patients with axSpA.
                    <sup type="ref">[60]</sup> Patients who smoke have worse scores on measures of function and disease progression, as well as more pain, poorer overall assessment of health, and reduced physical mobility and quality of life.

                <p>In patients who initially respond to TNF inhibitor treatment and then experience diminished efficacy over time, switching to another TNF inhibitor is a reasonable option.
                    <sup type="ref">[28]</sup> In case of primary nonresponse, it is important to consider whether this might be the result of an incorrect diagnosis.

                <p>The only other biologic currently approved for the treatment of AS is secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-17A.
                    <sup type="ref">[61]</sup> The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) and EULAR were the first to publish guidelines for management of axSpA after the FDA approval of secukinumab. Their joint recommendation is that, if TNF inhibitor therapy fails, a switch to either another TNF inhibitor or to anti-IL-17 therapy should be considered.
                    <sup type="ref">[5]</sup> This recommendation is supported by data suggesting that a second TNF inhibitor can be efficacious. However, the level of efficacy may be lower than with the first TNF inhibitor.
                    <sup type="ref">[62]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>Two randomized, controlled, phase 3 trials, MEASURE 1 and MEASURE 2, have examined the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in adults with active AS.
                    <sup type="ref">[12]</sup> The main difference in their design was that loading doses were intravenous in MEASURE 1 and SC in MEASURE 2 (maintenance doses were SC in both trials). According to a combined analysis of the 2 trials, secukinumab was associated with significant reductions in the signs and symptoms of AS at week 16. In both trials, placebo-treated patients switched to secukinumab after week 16 for a noncontrolled extension phase. Additional results from MEASURE 1 have been reported for patients who were originally randomized to 150 mg secukinumab (n=97) or 75 mg (n=103) and completed 2 years of follow-up. ASAS20 response rates at that time point were 73.7% and 68.0%, respectively.
                    <sup type="ref">[63]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>The MEASURE 2 trial is designed to last for 5 years, and 3 years of data have been published so far.
                    <sup type="ref">[64]</sup> The retention rate was &gt;80%, and secukinumab 150 mg was associated with sustained improvement on all endpoints, including disease activity, BASDAI score, ASDAS, and physical function.
                </p>
                <p>The new therapy should be chosen based on the individual patient's situation. If the patient had inadequate response to the first TNF inhibitor (primary nonresponse) or has to be switched due to an adverse event, it may be better to switch to anti-IL-17 therapy.</p>
