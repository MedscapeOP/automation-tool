<p><strong>Question type:</strong> CME Posttest</p>

<p><strong>Question Introduction (</strong><strong>optional &#953;):</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> All of the following are advantages associated with guselkumab therapy in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis EXCEPT:</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>A. It has a high level of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90/100 response</p>

<p>B. It has the potential for long-term remissions </p>

<p>C. It is injected only every 4 weeks</p>

<p>D. It has a favorable benefit/risk profile&#160;</p>

<p>Answer explanation: </p>

<p>After induction, interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors are effective when dosed every 8 to 12 weeks. Emerging results from randomized clinical trials suggest that selectively blocking IL-23 produces high levels of efficacy, therapeutic longevity, a favorable safety/tolerability profile, and the convenience of infrequent dosing.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Clinical Case 1: Patient History</strong></p>

<p>Christina is a 35-year-old laboratory technician with a 5-year history of plaque psoriasis. She has previously used topical emollients and corticosteroid creams, none of which optimally controlled her psoriasis. She presented to her general practitioner in great distress because of concerns about worsening symptoms. An extensive area of her body was affected, including her arms, legs, hands, and neck. She was referred to a dermatologist to discuss more effective treatment options for her plaque psoriasis. On examination, psoriasis was shown to affect 12% of Christina&#8217;s body surface area (BSA), and her Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is 11. She complained about intense itching and pain. According to her PASI and BSA scores, Christina has moderate to severe psoriasis. </p>

<p>After discussing options with her dermatologist, Christina agreed to try ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy, but this was unsuccessful in improving her condition. The dermatologist therefore recommended initiating therapy with methotrexate (MTX) prescribed at a dose of 15 mg/week subcutaneously, with the possibility of increasing the dose up to 20 mg/week in case of an insufficient response.</p>

<p><strong>Answer explanation: </strong>Guidance based on the consensus of experts from 19 European countries defines treatment success as at least a 75% improvement in PASI 75 from the time of treatment initiation.</p>

<p><strong> &lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Treatment Goals in Psoriasis</strong></p>

<p>Guidelines for the management of psoriasis with suggested treatment goals have been established in Canada,<sup>[1] </sup>Europe,<sup>[2-4]</sup> and the United Kingdom,<sup>[5] </sup>all of which are based largely on expert opinion. Most recommendations define treatment success as an improvement in PASI of at least 75% (PASI 75) or when a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of &#8804; 5 is reached in patients with a PASI improvement between 50% and 75%.<sup>[2-5] </sup> </p>

<p>Although PASI 75 response is frequently used as the primary efficacy outcome in clinical trials of biologic agents, PASI 90 is being increasingly recognized as the new standard in therapeutic efficacy for psoriasis.<sup>[6] </sup>PASI 90 response corresponds better with clear or almost clear psoriasis and is associated with an improvement in quality of life (QoL) compared with PASI 75.<sup>[7-9] </sup>In fact, PASI 90 has been considered a measure of treatment success by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is becoming the new therapeutic goal replacing PASI 75.<sup>[6,9-11]</sup> </p>

<p>The achievement of an absolute PASI score &lt; 2 or 3 has also been proposed as an indication of treatment success, with a PASI 2 score corresponding to a PASI 90 response and a PASI 5 score -- often considered the threshold for therapeutic adjustment or switching -- corresponding to a PASI &#8805; 75 response.<sup>[9]</sup> For example, in a recent study by Kem&eacute;ny and colleagues that evaluated the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab in patients according to psoriasis severity, consistency across severity groups was observed not only for PASI improvement but for absolute PASI data as well, with a comparable proportion of patients achieving a high level of clearance (ie, PASI &#8804; 2 and PASI &#8804; 1).<sup>[12]</sup> </p>

<p>Despite the establishment of treatment goals, both nontreatment and undertreatment of psoriasis are common, and patients&#8217; dissatisfaction with treatment is widespread.<sup>[13-17] </sup>In the large, multinational, population-based survey of patients with psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in North America and Europe (Multinational Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis [MAPP]) survey, 45% of patients with psoriasis reported that they had not seen a physician in a year and &gt; 80% said that they were not receiving treatment or were being treated with topical therapy only.<sup>[16] </sup>Among patients who had received oral or biologic therapy, 57% and 45%, respectively, discontinued treatment, most often for safety/tolerability reasons and for a lack or loss of efficacy.<sup>[16]</sup> Many patients who received suboptimal treatment regimens (eg, moisturizing creams or low-potency steroids) have low expectations when initiating new treatments and tend to underestimate the improvement they can achieve with a biologic agent.<sup>[16]</sup></p>

<p>Likewise, DISCOVER, the cross-sectional observational study conducted in Belgian dermatology centers, revealed that nearly 40% of Belgian patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were undertreated despite the severity of their disease.<sup>[17]</sup> Again, the main reasons for treatment discontinuation were side effects and lack of efficacy.<sup>[17]</sup> Patient dissatisfaction with current psoriasis treatment and overall management of the disease may result in poor treatment adherence, further increasing the risk for undertreatment.<sup>[18,19]</sup> </p>

<p>To improve psoriasis outcomes, it is important not only to define treatment goals but also to implement treatment goals for promptly adjusting therapy if the objectives are not met within 3 to 6 months or by the end of the induction phase of treatment with biologics.<sup>[2,20,21] </sup>Clinical response and patient perceptions should be assessed regularly in order to evaluate patients&#8217; satisfaction with the management of all aspects of their disease. </p>

<p><strong>Question 3: Which of the following should be considered when individualizing treatment for psoriasis?</strong></p>

<p>A. Risks/benefits of current therapies B. QoL C. Comorbidities D. Medical history E. All of the above</p>

<p><strong>Answer explanation:</strong> When treating patients with psoriasis, it is important to tailor treatments to meet an individual patient&#8217;s needs and to monitor the patient for any other commonly associated medical problems. Treatment choices may be influenced by various factors, including the severity of the disease, overall health of the patient, impact on QoL, tolerability of therapies and potential side effects, and the patient&#8217;s level of satisfaction with the treatment regimen. Patients should be evaluated regularly, with treatments being modified, refined, or changed as needed in order to achieve therapeutic goals.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Individualizing Patient Care in Psoriasis</strong></p>

<p>Well-defined treatment goals can help physicians in their care of patients with psoriasis. Such goals are based on outcome measures only, however, suggesting that changes measured by PASI and DLQI are of equal importance in all patients with psoriasis.<sup>[22]</sup> A patient-centered approach to managing psoriasis is becoming increasingly recommended, as it encourages patients to participate in their own treatment and disease management.  </p>

<p>Previous observational and clinical studies have shown that achieving total skin clearance is the most important treatment goal for most patients with psoriasis, as they reported fewer symptoms and signs of psoriasis, along with less impact on health-related QoL (HRQoL) as measured by DLQI.<sup>[23-26] </sup>Nevertheless, patients with moderate to severe psoriasis strive for a wide range of different treatment goals beyond skin clearance, including a reduction in itching, burning, and pain; attaining a normal everyday life; and a low treatment burden.<sup>[27,28] </sup>Analyzing patient needs on an individual level will facilitate shared decisions by patients and physicians, in terms of determining the optimal personalized treatment.<sup>[22,27,29]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Clinical Case 1, Continued: Suboptimal Response to Methotrexate</strong> Six months after treatment initiation with MTX, Christina began to experience flare-ups that prompted her to consult with her dermatologist. She is concerned that the MTX is not working and would like to discuss additional treatment options. During the discussion, Christina mentioned that for the last 3 months, she has also been suffering from severe abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, rectal pain, and unintentional weight loss of 4 kg. She has no history of bowel issues and has not recently taken antibiotics.</p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> A recent systematic review examined the risk of IBD in patient with psoriasis. </p>

<p><strong>Reporting priority: first</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question 4: Which of the following statements is true with regard to the risk of developing Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) in patients with psoriasis? </strong></p>

<p>A. Patients with psoriasis had an increased risk of CD and UC</p>

<p>B. Patients with psoriasis had an increased risk of CD but no increased risk of UC</p>

<p>C. Patients with psoriasis had an increased risk of UC but no increased risk of CD</p>

<p>D. Patients with psoriasis had no increased risk of CD and UC</p>

<p><strong>Answer explanation: </strong>In a systematic review and meta-analysis based on 5 case-control or cross-sectional studies and 4 cohort studies, with a total of nearly 8,000,000 participants, Fu and colleagues<sup> </sup>reported that according to the results from the 4 cohort studies, patients with psoriasis had an increased risk for CD (risk ratio, 2.53) and UC (risk ratio, 1.71).</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Association Between Psoriasis and IBD</strong></p>

<p>IBD is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, which includes CD and UC.<sup>[31,32] </sup>Whereas UC is restricted to the colon and reflects a continuous inflammation confined to the mucosal layer, CD is characterized by a discontinuous, granulomatous, and transmural inflammation that can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract.<sup>[31,32]</sup> Environmental, genetic, and immunologic factors, as well as the intestinal microbiota, have been considered as the major etiologies of IBD.<sup>[33]</sup></p>

<p>The coexistence of psoriasis and IBD has been observed in various clinical settings: they can appear as concomitant disease events in the same patient or as &#8220;paradoxical&#8221; treatment-related adverse events.<sup>[34] </sup>The pathogenesis of both diseases involves the innate and adaptive immune systems. The distinct similarities in the pathogenesis are also reflected in the wide overlapping of the therapeutic approaches used in both diseases.<sup>[35] </sup>In a nationwide Danish cohort study with a maximum follow-up of 16 years, Egeberg and coworkers observed significant associations between psoriasis and CD and UC.<sup>[36] </sup>Although patients with mild psoriasis had an increased risk for developing IBD, the risk was highest in patients with severe psoriasis.<sup>[36] </sup>Likewise, in a recent meta-analysis, Fu and colleagues examined the association between psoriasis and IBD, concluding that patients with psoriasis were more likely to have comorbid IBD.<sup>[30] </sup>In this meta-analysis, the evidence from the case-control studies indicated that among patients with psoriasis, the odds ratio (OR) for developing CD was 1.70 and the OR for developing UC was 1.75-fold, when compared with controls.<sup>[30]</sup> Moreover, the evidence from the cohort studies revealed that patients with psoriasis had a 2.53-fold increased risk for developing CD and a 1.71-fold increased risk for developing UC. The possible explanations for the identified association between psoriasis and IBD include shared genetic abnormalities, immune dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and dysregulation of gut microbiota.<sup>[30,35,37] </sup></p>

<p><strong>Question 5: Which of the following is the most appropriate next step when IBD is suspected in a patient with psoriasis?</strong></p>

<p>A. Prescribe a course of corticosteroids </p>

<p>B. Decrease the dose of MTX</p>

<p>C. Order an endoscopic examination with a tissue biopsy</p>

<p>D. Refer the patient to a gastroenterologist</p>

<p><strong>Answer explanation: </strong>After taking an in-depth clinical history and performing a physical examination, referral to a gastroenterologist for additional diagnostic testing is recommended whenever there is a strong suspicion of IBD in a patient with psoriasis. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Management of IBD in the Dermatology Office </strong></p>

<p>In patients with new-onset psoriasis, dermatologists are usually consulted, performing most of the initial diagnostic workup and providing initial prescriptions. Consequently, dermatologists often care for patients in whom the risk for comorbidities has not yet been identified. Therefore, they play an important role in early detection and determining the course regarding further treatment of their patients&#8217; comorbidities.<sup>[38] </sup>Knowledge and early initiation of treatment for comorbidities are also essential with respect to the initiation of adequate systemic psoriasis therapy. Dermatologists are not in a position to perform the entire workup and to provide all of the treatment for a specific comorbidity. Thus, simplified, guideline-oriented referral of patients with risks for comorbidities to the appropriate specialist is important.<sup>[38] </sup></p>

<p>For patients with psoriasis and comorbid IBD, it is therefore considered adequate for a dermatologist to take an appropriate medical history and conduct a clinical examination, and then to refer the patient to a gastroenterologist without performing additional diagnostic tests.<sup>[39] </sup>Furthermore, psoriasis is usually treated with medications that may interfere with some comorbidities, mainly through their adverse effects. Therefore, in order to address the comprehensive management of psoriasis and its comorbidities, it is critical to establish the dermatologist&#8217;s role in the diagnosis of psoriasis comorbidities and the criteria for referral to the appropriate specialist.<sup>[39]</sup></p>

<p>Patients with psoriasis and suspected IBD should be referred to a gastroenterologist if any of the following symptoms are present<sup>[39]</sup>: </p>

<p>&#8226;	Chronic diarrhea (&gt; 4 weeks)</p>

<p>&#8226;	Blood in stools</p>

<p>&#8226;	Rectal pain or bleeding</p>

<p>&#8226;	Bowel urgency</p>

<p>&#8226;	Rectal tenesmus</p>

<p>&#8226;	Chronic abdominal cramps or pain (&gt; 4 weeks)</p>

<p>Psoriasis and IBD can have profound and debilitating effects on the lives of patients, both at the physical and the psychosocial levels. As such, a concerted, patient-centered, multidisciplinary team approach to disease management for these conditions can help to encourage treatment adherence, improve outcomes, and enhance QoL for these patients. This multidisciplinary team approach involves the discussion of treatment options with both gastroenterologists and dermatologists as early as possible.<sup>[40]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Clinical Case 1, Continued: Confirming the Diagnosis of IBD </strong></p>

<p>Christina was referred to a gastroenterologist, who confirmed a diagnosis of CD based on the results of imaging and laboratory tests, along with her history and clinical presentation. </p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction: </strong>Helen is a psoriasis patient who has been recently diagnosed with CD. Helen questions her dermatologist about the efficacy and safety of therapeutic options available to her. </p>

<p><strong>Reporting priority: Second</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question 6. Considering available study data, which of the following therapies for psoriasis would be the LEAST appropriate choice for Helen?</strong></p>

<p>A. An IL-12/23 inhibitor</p>

<p>B. A tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; inhibitor</p>

<p>C. An IL-17 inhibitor</p>

<p>D. An IL-23 inhibitor</p>

<p><strong>Answer explanation:</strong> Studies have previously shown an association between IL-17 inhibitors and IBD exacerbations. Despite recent data indicating that cases of IBD were uncommon with ixekizumab and secukinumab, caution is recommended when prescribing IL-17 inhibitors to patients with active IBD, including CD and UC, as indicated in the Special warnings and precautions for use section of the Summary of Product Characteristics, and these patients should be followed closely. Brodalumab is contraindicated in patients with CD. Therefore, an IL-17 inhibitor such as brodalumab<sup> </sup>might not be the best choice for Helen.</p>

<p>Regarding IBD, infliximab and adalimumab are the only anti-TNF-&#945; agents that have been approved for the treatment of both UC and CD,<sup>[53,54]</sup> and golimumab is approved for use only in patients with UC.<sup>[55]</sup> The ACCENT-I and ACCENT -II studies proved the efficacy and guide the current use of infliximab in patients with CD.<sup>[56,57]</sup> The efficacy of adalimumab in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with CD was demonstrated in the CLASSIC-I (induction study) and CHARM (maintenance study), respectively.<sup>[58,59] </sup>In addition, a pivotal phase 3 trial of adalimumab demonstrated its efficacy in patients with CD, including those who failed infliximab therapy.<sup>[60]</sup> Indirect evidence suggests that there is no significant difference in efficacy between infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment of patients with CD.<sup>[61,62]</sup> </p>

<p>Results from 2 large multicenter, phase 3, placebo-controlled clinical trials -- PHOENIX 1<sup>[63]</sup> and PHOENIX 2<sup>[64]</sup> -- suggest that ustekinumab, administered at a dose of 45 mg or 90 mg every 12 weeks, is efficacious for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in adults (<strong>Table 3</strong>). In the ACCEPT trial, treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg showed clinical superiority to treatment with high-dose etanercept over a 12-week period in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (<strong>Table 3</strong>).<sup>[65]</sup> </p>

<p>Sources: Leonardi et al, 2008,<sup>[63] </sup>Papp et al, 2008,<sup>[64] </sup>and Griffiths et al, 2010.<sup>[65]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;end table&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p>Long-term 5-year efficacy data from both PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2 demonstrated maintenance of initial clinical response, with overall week 244 PASI 75 response rates of 63.4% and 76.5%, respectively, in the 45-mg groups, and 72.0% and 78.6%, respectively, in the 90-mg groups.<sup>[66,67]</sup>  </p>

<p>The approval of ustekinumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active CD, administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose (either 130 mg or approximately 6 mg per kg of body weight), was based on data from 3 pivotal phase 3 trials (2 induction trials [UNITI-1 and UNITI-2] and a maintenance trial [IM-UNITI]), which demonstrated that treatment with ustekinumab induced clinical response and maintained clinical remission in a significantly greater proportion of patients after 1 year of therapy compared with placebo.<sup>[68]</sup> </p>

<p>The German S3 Guideline recommends adalimumab and infliximab for the treatment of both psoriasis and IBD (CD and UC), and ustekinumab for the treatment of both psoriasis and CD.<sup>[11,69]</sup> Therefore, these biologic agents are the treatments of choice in patients with both psoriasis and UC or CD and would be suitable options for Christina.</p>

<p>The 3 IL-17 inhibitors approved for the treatment of psoriasis are all highly effective therapies, with a rapid onset of action. Secukinumab demonstrated an 81.6% PASI 75 response and a 28.6% PASI 100 response at week 12, with &gt; 80% of patients maintaining PASI 75 up to week 52.<sup>[70]</sup> At week 12, treatment with ixekizumab was associated with an 89.1% PASI 75 response rate and a 35.3% PASI 100 response rate; in this study, 78% of patients maintained their response through 60 weeks of treatment.<sup>[71]</sup> Ixekizumab has also been shown to work quickly, with a significant difference from placebo by week 1, a 50% PASI 75 response by week 4, and a 50% PASI 90 response by week 8. Treatment with brodalumab has been associated with an 83% PASI 75 response rate, a 70% PASI 90 response rate, and a 42% PASI 100 response rate by week 12<sup>[72]</sup> and has proven clinical superiority to ustekinumab.<sup>[73]</sup> </p>

<p>Studies have previously shown an association between IL-17 inhibitors and both exacerbations and new-onset cases of IBD.<sup>[74-76]</sup> A recent secukinumab safety analysis of 7355 patients across 21 clinical trials, however, spanning up to 5 years of treatment for psoriasis, revealed that cases of IBD were uncommon (&lt; 1%).<sup>[77]</sup> Similarly, an integrated database of 7 randomized, controlled and uncontrolled ixekizumab psoriasis trials showed that cases of IBD were also uncommon (&lt; 1%).<sup>[76]</sup> Nevertheless, caution is recommended when prescribing IL-17 inhibitors to patients with both psoriasis and active IBD. In fact, the Summary of Product Characteristics for both secukinumab and ixekizumab include warnings and precautions for use in patients with IBD.<sup>[41,42]</sup> </p>

<p>In a phase 2 study of brodalumab in patients with moderate to severe CD, the agent demonstrated a lack of therapeutic efficacy. This study was terminated early because of a disproportionate number of patients experiencing worsening of disease.<sup>[78]</sup> It should be noted, however, that brodalumab acts by blocking the IL-17 receptor and, hence, may have a broader effect on bowel inflammation compared with secukinumab and ixekizumab, both of which target IL-17A only. Consequently, brodalumab is contraindicated in patients with CD.<sup>[43]</sup> This is also reflected in guidelines and expert opinion treatment recommendations.<sup>[79,80]</sup> </p>

<p>Regarding the IL-23 inhibitors, guselkumab was approved in the European Union for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, based on the results of 3 phase 3 trials: VOYAGE 1, VOYAGE 2, and NAVIGATE <strong>(Table 4)</strong>.<sup>[81-83]</sup> The major findings from these trials demonstrate the efficacy of guselkumab for the management of psoriasis and its superiority over adalimumab and ustekinumab. In addition, a recent phase 3 head-to-head study has assessed the safety and efficacy of guselkumab vs secukinumab in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, demonstrating the superiority of guselkumab use in achieving PASI 90 response vs secukinumab at week 48 <strong>(Table 4).</strong><sup>84</sup></p>

<p>New long-term data from the open-label period of the VOYAGE 1 trial demonstrate well-maintained rates of skin clearance with guselkumab treatment at  week 52 and week 156 among adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.<sup>[85] </sup>At week 156, in the combined group of patients initially randomized to guselkumab, or to placebo with crossover to guselkumab at week 16, a total of 82.1% achieved an Investigator&#8217;s Global Assessment (IGA) score of &#8804; 1, 93.7% achieved a PASI 75 score, and 82.8% achieved a PASI 90 score.<sup>[85]</sup> At week 156, overall, 53.1% of patients achieved an IGA score of 0 and 50.8% of patients achieved a PASI 100 response.<sup>[85] </sup>  </p>

<p>These findings highlight the consistency in high rates of complete resolution of psoriasis with guselkumab treatment at weeks 48, 100, and 156, with maintenance therapy administered every 8 weeks. This may be important in the context of durability of efficacy and potential extension of the dosing interval. </p>

<p>European approval of tildrakizumab for the treatment of psoriasis was based on results from 2 pivotal trials -- reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 -- which established superior efficacy compared with placebo and etanercept, respectively (<strong>Table 4</strong>).<sup>[86]</sup></p>

<p>Although risankizumab&#160;has not yet been approved for the treatment of psoriasis, 3 phase 3 studies of the agent have recently been completed, with all primary and secondary endpoints having been met, along with a fourth phase 3 trial that satisfied the primary endpoints as well.<sup>[87-89]</sup> The results from these trials confirmed the efficacy of a subcutaneous regimen of risankizumab 150&#160;mg administered at weeks 0 and 4 and then every 12&#160;weeks thereafter, in patients with psoriasis. The studies demonstrated the superior efficacy of risankizumab compared with both adalimumab and ustekinumab for the treatment of psoriasis.</p>

<p> Guselkumab is currently being investigated in patients with CD in the GALAXI clinical program. This program consists of 3 separate studies: a 48-week, phase 2 dose-ranging study (GALAXI 1) and two 48-week, phase 3 confirmatory studies (GALAXI 2 and GALAXI 3).<sup>[90]</sup></p>

<p>Currently, there are no phase 2 or phase 3 trials registered with either ClinicalTrials.gov or the European Union Clinical Trials Register that are evaluating treatment with tildrakizumab in patients with CD.</p>

<p>Risankizumab is currently being investigated in a phase 2 study in patients with moderate to severe CD. In this study, 31% of patients who received IV induction doses of risankizumab 200 or 600&#160;mg every 4&#160;weeks achieved clinical remission at week 12, compared with 15% who received placebo.<sup>[91,92]</sup> Phase 3 clinical trials of risankizumab for the treatment of CD are ongoing,<sup>[93,94] </sup>with phase 2b/3 trials for the treatment of UC continuing as well.<sup>[95]</sup></p>

<p>Overall, emerging results from randomized clinical trials in patients with psoriasis and CD suggest that selectively blocking IL-23 is associated with rapid and high levels of efficacy, therapeutic longevity, a favorable safety/tolerability profile, and the convenience of infrequent dosing.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Clinical Case 1: Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>After discussions with her gastroenterologist and dermatologist about the positive clinical benefits of the 3 biologic agents currently available to treat her psoriasis and CD, Christina agrees to begin treatment with ustekinumab. Three months after starting ustekinumab, she reported a complete disappearance of her skin lesions and improvement in her digestive symptoms. In the future, an IL-23 inhibitor may prove to be an appropriate option for a biologic-naive patient with both psoriasis and IBD, but at the moment, none are licensed in IBD.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Clinical Case 2: Patient History</strong></p>

<p>John, a 50-year-old consultant, presents to his dermatologist for evaluation of his plaque psoriasis that developed 8 years ago. His medical history includes multiple comorbidities: obesity (weight, 152 kg; height, 1.8 m; and body mass index [BMI], 41 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, and depression. John is being treated with topical corticosteroids and UVB phototherapy but with only a moderate response. Current medications for his comorbidities include metformin, lisinopril, fenofibrate, fluticasone plus salmeterol, and fluoxetine.</p>

<p>John reports that his psoriasis is having a severe impact on his QoL and personal relationships, and he feels uncomfortable about his condition and his weight. </p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p><strong>Question 7. According to clinical recommendations from several dermatology medical societies, how would you address John's psychosocial issues associated with psoriasis?</strong></p>

<p>A. Ask him to complete the DLQI form B. Initiate therapy immediately because clear skin will improve his mood C. Refer him to a colleague who can manage his psoriasis, obesity, and personal issues D. Refer him to a psychologist/psychiatrist for counseling</p>

<p><strong>Answer explanation:</strong> Recommendations from the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD), and the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) include measurement of HRQoL with a validated tool, such as the DLQI, prior to initiation of psoriasis therapy and/or to monitor a patient&#8217;s response to therapy.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Management of Comorbidities in a Patient With Psoriasis</strong></p>

<p>Given the systemic nature of psoriasis as an inflammatory condition that is associated with high rates of comorbid disorders, management of these associated conditions is critical. Therefore, a sophisticated algorithm has been proposed to manage comorbidities, drug treatment, risk, and trigger factors.<sup>[96]</sup> The prospective, longitudinal, disease-based Psoriasis Longitudinal Assessment and Registry (PSOLAR)<sup>[97]</sup> analyzed data from 9495 patients, reporting high rates of overweight and obesity (~80%), cardiovascular disease (38.8%), hypertension (29.7%), and hyperlipidemia (18.6%).<sup>[98]</sup> Patients with psoriasis are also much more likely than individuals without the disorder to have IBD, such as CD or UC, perhaps reflecting a shared underlying genetic susceptibility.<sup>[35]</sup> </p>

<p>The physical and psychosocial burden of psoriasis and its related comorbidities can have a profound negative impact on a patient&#8217;s HRQoL and work productivity, placing the individual at a significant risk for such psychological conditions as depression.<sup>[99]</sup> Indeed, PSOLAR also confirmed an increased risk for psychiatric disorders in patients with psoriasis.<sup>[97]</sup> &#160;</p>

<p>A systematic review of global studies found that the prevalence of depression among patients with psoriasis ranged from 2.10% to 33.7%, compared with a lower prevalence of 0% to 22.7% among healthy controls.<sup>[100]</sup> The prevalence of suicidality among patients with psoriasis can be as high as 37.4% during a lifetime, vs 1.01% to 1.94% among the general population, with two-thirds of patients attributing suicidal ideation to their psoriasis.<sup>[101,102] </sup>Comorbid depression clearly confers a greater risk for suicide among patients with psoriasis than does severity of the disease alone. In one UK study, major depression contributed to a 10-fold increased risk for suicide among patients with psoriasis.<sup>[100,103]</sup> Moreover, depression in patients with psoriasis may reduce adherence to treatment, resulting in more severe disease and more depression.<sup>[104]</sup> Therefore, managing depression may improve both treatment adherence and patient outcomes. </p>

<p>Although many dermatologists acknowledge that the risk for depression and suicidality exists among patients with psoriasis, few take any action to address the issue.<sup>[105]</sup> This highlights the need for appropriate screening methods in practice, in order to encourage early identification and treatment of depression among this patient population. For example, a thorough discussion of the patient's answers to the DLQI and Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) is essential for understanding how psoriasis affects the patient's life, as well as for determining the best course of treatment to improve the patient's QoL. In fact, clinical practice guidelines and expert recommendations on the treatment and management of psoriasis acknowledge the importance of addressing comprehensive care for this patient population, including the implementation of preventive screening measures to regularly monitor for depression.<sup>[39,106] </sup></p>

<p>Providing appropriate management of psoriasis from an early stage requires prompt diagnosis and treatment of concomitant diseases, in order to prevent any potential comorbidities.<sup>[39]</sup> Such an integrated approach also ensures that the medications used to treat associated diseases do not interfere with the management of psoriasis and vice versa (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).<sup>[39,96]</sup> </p>

<p>&lt;&lt;insert figure 1&gt;&gt;       </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Clinical Case 2, Continued: Psoriasis and Nail Disease </strong></p>

<p>John&#8217;s discomfort was affecting his ability to work and his QoL, because of psychosocial impairments and a DLQI of 25. This correlated with an increase in his PASI score from 8 to 14, reflecting worsening psoriasis. He also complains of pain in his fingernails, which show signs of pitting and discoloration. Close examination with a hand lens and a Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) of 54 confirmed the diagnosis of nail psoriasis. He is dissatisfied with his current disease control, stating that new skin lesions have also appeared over the past few weeks. As he is increasingly anxious and keen to see a rapid improvement in his skin and nail disease, John and his dermatologist discuss treatment options. </p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p><strong>Question 8. Based on John&#8217;s medical history and current medications, which treatment would you recommend for both his skin and nail disease?</strong></p>

<p>A. Ustekinumab B. Adalimumab C. Brodalumab D. Secukinumab</p>

<p><strong>Answer explanation:</strong> In clinical studies, the most promising data for improving nail psoriasis has been shown with adalimumab and guselkumab.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Treatment of Psoriasis and Nail Disease </strong></p>

<p>Nail psoriasis is a common clinical diagnosis generally made in the context of existing psoriatic skin lesions. Approximately 50% of patients with psoriasis have some nail involvement, with the lifetime incidence of nail disease estimated to be between 80% and 90%.<sup>[107,108]</sup>   </p>

<p>Clinically, nail disease has many presentations, depending on the location of the inflammatory process, which can occur in the matrix, the nail bed, or the periungual tissue, resulting in distinct injury patterns.<sup>[109]</sup> Importantly, nail psoriasis can lead to impairment in QoL and work function, because of pain, discomfort, and poor aesthetic aspects.<sup>[109,110]</sup> </p>

<p>Although nail psoriasis is a common and important disease, a paucity of randomized controlled trials are available that focus specifically on this condition, in order to help guide treatment plans. Treating nail involvement in psoriasis is important for improving patients&#8217; health outcomes and QoL.<sup>[111,112]</sup> The treatment pf nail psoriasis is challenging because of the slow disease resolution in response to therapy, which is related to the slow rate of nail growth. Indeed, clinical improvements in nail disease typically lag behind those in skin disease, but efficacy in nail psoriasis can be observed at 12 weeks, with additional improvements or even completely normal nails seen at 1 year.<sup>[113]</sup> Numerous studies have shown that conventional therapies, such as MTX and cyclosporine, are likely to be less effective and slower-acting than biologics in treating nail disease. In addition, conventional treatments are generally difficult to administer, are considered inconvenient by patients, are limited by adverse events, and often lose efficacy over time.<sup>[114,115]</sup> </p>

<p>Biologic agents have improved the treatment of psoriasis and PsA and are the most effective agents for treating psoriatic nail disease as well. The inflammation can be suppressed with anti-TNF-&#945; treatments, as well as with anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-12/23 monoclonal antibodies.<sup>[112,114]</sup> </p>

<p>A recent phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and moderate to severe fingernail psoriasis. At 26 weeks, 48.9% of adults who received adalimumab achieved a PGA for Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) score of 0 or 1, with &#8805; 2 grades of improvement from baseline, compared with 6.9% of patients who received placebo (<em>P </em>&lt;.001).<sup>[116]</sup> In fact, based on this study, adalimumab was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as the first and only biologic treatment for nail psoriasis. In the European Union, however, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) considers that the current view on wording of the therapeutic indication is that nail psoriasis is covered by the current indication, which is consistent with recent approvals of other products indicated for the treatment of patients with plaque psoriasis.<sup>[54,117]</sup> This study, which was designed specifically to evaluate fingernail psoriasis, addresses the prior lack of approved biologic agents to treat the condition and the previously limited clinical trial data supporting the effectiveness of biologics for nail psoriasis.<sup>[116]</sup> These results also support recently published nail psoriasis guidelines that identify adalimumab as a recommended biologic treatment for patients with significant nail disease and concomitant skin and/or joint disease.<sup>[79,110]</sup> </p>

<p>In a secondary analysis of the VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 trials, compared with adalimumab, guselkumab was associated with significant improvement in psoriasis on the scalp and palms and/or soles. The magnitude of improvement in the fingernails, however, did not differ between the 2 treatments after 6 months.<sup>[117,118]</sup> </p>

<p>The PHOENIX 1 study showed that ustekinumab improves the nail manifestations of psoriasis over time for up to 1 year, indicating that skin and nail responses to ustekinumab therapy may be correlated. Nail improvement was higher in patients with a good PASI response, and the improvement in the NAPSI scale ranged from 29.7% to 57.3% at 24 weeks.<sup>[119]</sup> </p>

<p>In the TRANSFIGURE study, treatment with subcutaneous secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg at 16 weeks in patients with moderate to severe nail psoriasis resulted in superior efficacy to placebo, as measured by NAPSI percent change at week 16 (<em>P </em>&lt;.0001). Specifically, the mean NAPSI percentage changes were  -45.3% with secukinumab 300 mg, -37.9% with secukinumab 150 mg, and -10.8% with placebo.<sup>[120]</sup> An interim analysis at week 80 demonstrated the continuation of improvement in nail psoriasis for all efficacy parameters. The effect was sustained through 2.5 years, with a large mean NAPSI improvement from baseline of -73.3% and -63.6% with secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg, respectively.<sup>[121]</sup> </p>

<p>The UNCOVER-3 trial randomized patients to placebo, etanercept, or ixekizumab as 1 injection administered every 4 weeks or every 2 weeks. At week 12, significant improvements in fingernail psoriasis were achieved with ixekizumab therapy. With the maintenance dosing (every 4 weeks), additional improvement was demonstrated through 60 weeks, with &gt; 50% of patients achieving complete resolution.<sup>[122]</sup></p>

<p>Brodalumab has also demonstrated efficacy in improving nail psoriasis in phase 3 trials.<sup>[123]</sup> There have been reports of suicidal behavior, however, in patients taking brodalumab. Although there is no evidence of a link to the agent, the decision to start brodalumab in patients who have experienced suicidal behavior in the past, or have experienced depression or anxiety, should be made after carefully exploring all the risks and benefits for that particular patient. As John is currently taking medication for his depression, brodalumab is not an appropriate choice for him.<sup>[43]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Clinical Case 2, Continued: Initiating Treatment With Adalimumab</strong></p>

<p>After discussing therapeutic options with John, he agrees to begin treatment with adalimumab. His psoriasis improved to 10% BSA involvement over the next  3 months. His skin responded well to adalimumab for 9 months.</p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction: </strong>John is a 50-year-old man with psoriasis and multiple comorbidities: obesity (weight, 152 kg; height, 1.8 m; and BMI, 41 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, and depression. His physician prescribed adalimumab; however, after responding well for 9 months, he began experiencing increased severity of itching and scaling of existing lesions, with new lesions appearing on his back and upper arms, as well as ongoing issues with his nails. John has been adherent to his medications. </p>

<p><strong>Reporting priority: Third</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question 9. What would you recommend as the next treatment option for John?</strong></p>

<p>A.	Ustekinumab</p>

<p>B.	Guselkumab</p>

<p>C.	Ixekizumab</p>

<p>D.	Secukinumab</p>

<p><strong>Answer explanation: </strong>Evidence from clinical trials and indirect comparisons demonstrate that guselkumab is more effective than TNF-&#945; inhibitors (ie, adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab), ustekinumab, and secukinumab. It also suggests that guselkumab is likely to provide similar clinical benefits to ixekizumab.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Switching Biologic Agents in Psoriasis</strong></p>

<p>Although biologics have greatly improved psoriasis therapy, currently available biological agents are not curative and not all patients respond well to their first biologic agent. According to the European S3-Guidelines on the systemic treatment of plaque psoriasis,<sup>[69]</sup> if patients are dissatisfied with their response or their QoL has declined significantly, their current therapy should be reconsidered and optimized. Reasons for the failure may be primary failure (ie, lack of initial efficacy), secondary failure (ie, loss of efficacy over time), or development of intolerance to the agent, accompanied by drug reactions or adverse effects.<sup>[124]</sup>  </p>

<p>For patients who seek maximum skin clearance and improved QoL, switching to a second biologic agent is now a viable option. This can improve outcomes for many patients with psoriasis, although guidance on switching practices is limited.<sup>[125,126]</sup> The BAD guidelines for biologic therapy for psoriasis suggest that if a patient needs to switch to a second-line biologic, many factors need to be considered, including the washout period, the pharmacology of the agent, the patient&#8217;s clinical circumstances, and the patient&#8217;s views on the risks and benefits of transitioning. The guideline, however, did not suggest the optimal order of biologics after failure of the first biologic agent.<sup>[79]</sup> </p>

<p>Indeed, whereas many good treatment options are currently available for plaque psoriasis, long-term comparative safety and efficacy data are required in order to offer the best recommendations for patients.</p>

<p>The results of a network meta-analysis that used data from 45 clinical trials suggest that guselkumab was statistically significantly more effective, in terms of PASI 75 response, than the TNF-&#945; inhibitors (ie, adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab) and ustekinumab. Guselkumab was found to be similarly effective to ixekizumab and therefore considered to provide similar benefits in clinical practice. In the meta-analysis, guselkumab appeared to be statistically significantly better than secukinumab in terms of PASI 75 response. The superiority of guselkumab over secukinumab was recently confirmed in the ECLIPSE study.<sup>[84]</sup> In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, head-to-head, phase 3 study, 84.5% of guselkumab-treated patients achieved at least a PASI 90 score at week 48, compared with 70.0% of secukinumab-treated patients <em>(P </em>&lt;.001).<sup>84</sup> Although the results of the study confirm a slightly more rapid onset of response with secukinumab,<sup>[84]</sup> guselkumab offers patients not only high levels of skin clearance but a consistent maintenance of efficacy as well.<sup>[83]</sup> </p>

<p>Besides its promising efficacy data, guselkumab may encourage increased treatment adherence because of its administration regimen (ie, 100-mg subcutaneous injection at weeks 0 and 4, followed by a maintenance dose every 8 weeks thereafter),<sup>[127]</sup> which is more favorable than that of the anti-TNF-&#945; therapies and  IL-17 inhibitors. </p>

<p>Guselkumab was directly compared with adalimumab in 2 trials: VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2.<sup>[81,82]</sup> In these trials, guselkumab was associated with statistically significant improvements in primary and secondary outcomes, including PASI response rates, compared with adalimumab.<sup>[81,82]</sup></p>

<p>In the VOYAGE 1 trial, significantly higher proportions of patients treated with guselkumab, compared with adalimumab and placebo, achieved an IGA score of 0/1 (85.1% with guselkumab, 65.9% with adalimumab, 6.9% with placebo; <em>P </em>&lt;.001) and a PASI 90 response (73.3% with guselkumab, 49.7% with adalimumab, 2.9% with placebo;<em> P </em>&lt;.001) at week 16. These higher responses with guselkumab vs adalimumab were maintained through week 48 (IGA 0/1: 80.5% vs 55.4%, respectively; PASI 90: 76.3% vs 47.9%, respectively; <em>P </em>&lt;.001).<sup>[81]</sup> Regarding secondary endpoints, guselkumab performed well against adalimumab and placebo, achieving comparable or significantly better scores for scalp, nail, and DLQI assessments at week 16 and week 48. Interestingly, guselkumab achieved a lower PGA-F score at week 16 than adalimumab (39.1% vs 50.9%, respectively), although at week 48, this was reversed (74.7% vs, 61.8% adalimumab, respectively),<sup>[81]</sup> suggesting that guselkumab may have a slower onset of action but higher peak efficacy for nail disease.  </p>

<p>In the VOYAGE 2 study, significantly higher proportions of patients treated with guselkumab, compared with adalimumab and placebo, achieved IGA 0/1 (84.1% with guselkumab, 67.7% with adalimumab, 8.5% with placebo; <em>P </em>&lt;.001) and PASI 90 (70.0% with guselkumab, 46.8% with adalimumab, 2.4% with placebo;  <em>P </em>&lt;.001) than placebo or adalimumab at week 16.<sup>[82]</sup> </p>

<p>For secondary endpoints, guselkumab performed well against adalimumab and placebo, achieving comparable or significantly better scores for scalp, nail, and DLQI assessments at week 16 and week 24. Regarding the withdrawal and retreatment period, PASI 90 responses were better in the guselkumab maintenance group (88.6%) compared with the withdrawal group (36.8%) at week 48. Among adalimumab nonresponders who switched to guselkumab, the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 90 response reached 66.1% at week 48.<sup>[82]</sup>  </p>

<p>The results of the VOYAGE 2 trial revealed some important clinical insights:</p>

<p>&#8226;	In patients who were considered nonresponders at 28 weeks of adalimumab treatment, subsequent treatment with guselkumab resulted in approximately two-thirds of patients achieving a PASI 90 response. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Patients treated with guselkumab conserved their higher clinical responses between weeks 24 and 48, compared with the clinical responses observed in the adalimumab group. </p>

<p>These data are significant regarding the need for continuing treatment with guselkumab in order to maintain the highest level of response and successful transition from adalimumab to guselkumab.</p>

<p>Guselkumab provides an alternative mechanism of action with high efficacy and safety profiles, sustained total skin clearance, and rapid onset of effect. It is therefore a suitable treatment option for John at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p><strong>Question 10. What is the risk for individuals with psoriasis and nail involvement developing PsA?</strong></p>

<p>A. 3.89-fold increased risk</p>

<p>B. 2.93-fold increased risk</p>

<p>C. 2.35-fold increased risk</p>

<p>D. 1.54-fold increased risk</p>

<p><strong>Answer explanation:</strong> A study that investigated psoriasis features associated with a higher risk for PsA found that individuals with psoriasis and nail dystrophy were almost 3 times more likely to develop PsA (hazard ratio, 2.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.68, 5.12) than those without nail involvement.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Role of the Dermatologist in the Management of Patients With PsA</strong></p>

<p>Many patients can have psoriasis for several years before developing PsA.<sup>[128]</sup> Moreover, an average of 5 years&#8217; delay usually elapses between the onset of joint symptoms and a PsA diagnosis.<sup>[129]</sup> In fact, a systematic review found that 15.5% of patients with psoriasis seen at dermatologic centers had undiagnosed PsA.<sup>[130]</sup> Early diagnosis and prompt therapeutic intervention are crucial for limiting PsA progression, preventing disability, and improving QoL. Joint damage may develop in the first years of the PsA course, with even a 6-month diagnostic delay contributing to worse long-term radiographic and functional outcomes.<sup>[131]</sup> Therefore, dermatologists play a pivotal role in the early identification of patients with PsA and in the prevention of irreversible joint damage.<sup>[132,133]</sup> </p>

<p>Early recognition of PsA by dermatologists may provide an opportunity to improve patients&#8217; outcomes through close cooperation with a rheumatologist. Patients should be questioned about joint pain, stiffness, and swelling at every visit, and the findings should be documented to include the onset and duration of symptoms.<sup>[134-136]</sup> </p>

<p>Driven by the need for early identification and treatment of PsA, a number of screening tools have been developed and validated.<sup>[137,138]</sup> According to an expert consensus aimed at guiding dermatologists in the management of patients with PsA in their clinical practices, the most useful screening tools include the Psoriatic Arthritis Screening Evaluation (PASE), the Psoriasis Epidemiological Screening Trial (PEST), the Early ARthritis Psoriatic (EARP) questionnaire, and the Psoriatic Arthritis Screening (SiPAS) questionnaire.<sup>[132]</sup> All of these screening tools should be administered by dermatologists at the initial diagnosis of psoriasis and periodically thereafter in patients&#8217; follow-up visits. </p>

<p>Differentiating inflammatory from noninflammatory arthritis symptoms is an important clinical aspect that can guide the dermatologist in determining whether to screen and refer a patient with psoriasis and possible PsA to a rheumatologist. A simple screening mnemonic, &#8220;PSA,&#8221; has been established to remind dermatologists and other clinicians of the most basic clinical features that distinguish inflammatory from noninflammatory arthritis (<strong>Table 5</strong>). The presence of 2 out of 3 of these features should prompt the use of a formal validated screening tool and/or referral to a rheumatologist for evaluation.<sup>[139]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;end table&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p>The concomitant occurrence of PsA and psoriasis influences an individual&#8217;s treatment by increasing its complexity, particularly in patients with comorbid and other coprevalent conditions. Treatments should be tailored to achieve clinical remission, improve patients&#8217; health and QoL, and limit the extent of erosive damage.<sup>[140]</sup> Potential drug interactions should be considered and, importantly, some therapies that are effective for plaque psoriasis may be ineffective or less effective for PsA or for certain specific features of PsA.<sup>[141]</sup> </p>

<p>The anti-TNF-&#945; agents (ie, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, infliximab, and golimumab) are similarly effective in the different clinical subsets of PsA, including synovitis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and axial disease. Moreover, these agents are also effective for skin and nail psoriatic lesions, although with different potency.<sup>[142]</sup> Ustekinumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab are also approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and PsA.<sup>[41,42,143]</sup> Guselkumab has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis,<sup>[127]</sup> and although the agent is not currently approved for the treatment of PsA, it is the first anti-IL-23 biologic to demonstrate efficacy in this indication. Clinically significant effects on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 (&#8805; 20% improvement in ACR criteria), ACR 50 (&#8805; 50% improvement in ACR criteria), and ACR 70 (&#8805; 70% improvement in ACR criteria) scores, enthesitis, and dactylitis at 24 weeks were reported in a phase 2 trial,<sup>[144]</sup> and phase 3 trials are currently under way. </p>

<p>In addition to pharmacotherapy, lifestyle modifications, including weight reduction in obese patients, is also important in the global management of patients with psoriasis and PsA.<sup>[38,145]</sup> </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Clinical Case 2, Continued: Switching Treatment to Guselkumab </strong></p>

<p>John and his dermatologist decide to switch his therapy to guselkumab. He has been taking guselkumab for a few months now, and although there is a significant reduction in his skin and nail lesions, his skin is still not completely clear.</p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p><strong>Question 11. Which of the following lifestyle modifications would you recommend to John in an effort to improve his treatment outcomes?</strong></p>

<p><a name="_Hlk532218143"></a>A. Limit his salt intake </p>

<p>B. Incorporate weight-reduction strategies</p>

<p>C. Limit his alcohol intake </p>

<p>D. None of the above</p>

<p><strong>Answer explanation: </strong>Obesity is a major factor in the management of patients with psoriasis, with implications in treatment efficacy and safety. Moreover, weight loss has been shown to have a positive effect on psoriasis severity and response to treatment.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Management of Obesity in Patients With</strong> <strong>Psoriasis</strong></p>

<p>Obesity is an independent risk factor for psoriasis and PsA. Recent data from large Swedish and Danish cohorts show that over a span of 15 to 25 years, significant weight loss following gastric bypass surgery reduced the prevalence of psoriasis by nearly 50%.<sup>[146,147]</sup> In addition, obesity may have important effects on psoriasis severity and response to therapy. The&#160;impact of dietary and&#160;lifestyle&#160;weight&#160;loss&#160;interventions on&#160;psoriasis&#160;severity was recently assessed in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials that included 878 participants.<sup>[148]</sup> A greater reduction in PASI response was reported in patients receiving weight loss intervention than in controls, with a pooled mean difference of -2.49 (95% CI: -3.90, -1.08; <em>P</em> =.004). More participants in the intervention group than in the control group achieved a PASI 75 response, with a pooled OR of 2.92 (95% CI: 1.39, 6.13; <em>P</em> =.005).<sup>[148]</sup></p>

<p>Importantly, weight loss may improve response to biologic therapy, as suggested by a study that evaluated the effect of weight reduction by diet modification on treatment efficacy among obese patients with psoriasis who were receiving adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, or ustekinumab.<sup>[149]</sup> In this study, 262 patients were randomized to 8 weeks of dietary intervention, and the control group received a normal diet. PASI scores were assessed at baseline and then every 4 weeks up to week 24. A significant improvement in PASI response was observed in the intervention group compared with the control group. At the end of  24 weeks, the dietary intervention group lost 12.9 &#177; 1.2 kg, whereas the control group lost only -1.5 &#177; 0.5 kg. The average improvement in mean PASI score was 84% in the diet group vs 69% in the control group. PASI 75 was achieved by 85.9% of participants in the intervention group compared with 59.3% of individuals in the control group (<em>P</em> &lt;.001).<sup>[149]</sup> </p>

<p>In another study, Carrascosa and colleagues reported that a 5-unit increase in BMI (similar to a change in BMI category from normal weight to overweight and from overweight to obesity) was associated with a 12% increased risk for discontinuing therapy because of lack of effectiveness and a 17% increased risk for experiencing an adverse event, both independently of the drug being used.<sup>[150]</sup> </p>

<p>In a study that assessed the efficacy and safety of different doses of secukinumab, patients who weighed &lt; 90 kg had a higher response rates than did those who weighed &#8805; 90 kg after 12 weeks of therapy. In particular, PASI 75 response rates were 83% and 73% in patients who weighed &lt; 90 kg and &#8805; 90 kg, respectively. Similarly, PASI 90 response rates were 63% and 45% in patients who weighed &lt; 90 kg vs those who weighed &#8805; 90 kg, respectively.<sup>[151]</sup> </p>

<p>When managing obese patients with psoriasis, dermatologists should first aim to treat the psoriasis and then help to improve the components of the metabolic syndrome by recommending weight loss and collaborating with other healthcare professionals.</p>

<p>Indeed, dermatologists are ideally positioned for the early detection of metabolic disorders and for the promotion of healthy lifestyles, such as diet and physical activity interventions.<sup>[145]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 1&gt;&gt; Clinical Case 2: Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Following a discussion with his physician, John agrees to make a concerted effort to lose weight by following a calorie-restricted diet. At his consultation  3 months later, John appears happier and is pleased to announce that he has lost 7 kg. His skin and nail disease have improved greatly, with about a 5% BSA involvement. The patient will return in 3 months for further evaluation of his treatment progress.</p>
