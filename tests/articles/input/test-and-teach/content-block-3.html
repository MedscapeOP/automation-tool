<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion</strong></p>

<p>MRI may show signs of inflammation much earlier than radiographs show structural damage. MRI allows early detection of sacroiliac joint inflammation in patients with axSpA.<sup type="ref">[9,10]</sup> A gadolinium-enhanced image can detect areas of increased vascularization, helping detect synovitis and enthesitis; however, it does not necessarily add value to the diagnostic capacity of the MRI over STIR or T1 sequences in diagnosing early axSpA.<sup type="ref">[9]</sup> During the inflammatory phase, a STIR image will typically show hyperintensity in the bone marrow (termed "bone marrow edema") on both sides of the sacroiliac joints.<sup type="ref">[11]</sup> As such, to save time and to reduce patient burden, cost, and risk, gadolinium administration is not needed. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 1 Continues</strong></p>

<p>MRI of the sacroiliac joints is obtained. The T1-weighted image shows some evidence of erosions and sclerosis, and the STIR image shows evidence of bone marrow edema at the inferior corner of the iliac and the sacral side of the joint. Based on these imaging findings, the diagnosis of nr-axSpA is confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p>Jason is a 37-year-old man with progressively worsening lower back pain. His initial regimen when he first sought treatment at age 25 was ibuprofen 400 mg every 6 hours , which provided significant symptom relief. However, intolerable gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects after about 5 years of ibuprofen use prompted a switch to naproxen 220 mg BID. This provided relief for a time, but no longer adequately controls his pain. Jason reports his back pain is worse in the morning but is somewhat relieved with movement. Also, his back pain disrupts his sleep about 3 or 4 hours into the night. Neither chiropractic treatment nor physical therapy has resulted in lasting symptom relief. Based on workup and MRI scan findings, a diagnosis of nr-axSpA is confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> According to American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of America (SAA)/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN) guidelines, which of the following is the next best step for Jason?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#9633;	Increase the NSAID dose and add physical therapy</p>

<p>&#9633;	Start a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, since he has active disease refractory to NSAIDs</p>

<p>&#9633;	Start treatment with sulfasalazine </p>

<p>&#9633;	Start prednisone 1 mg/kg/d for 10 days, followed by tapering therapy over 1 month</p>
