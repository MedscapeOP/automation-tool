<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion </strong></p>

<p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first-line treatment for nr-axSpA. Although these are effective in reducing inflammation, pain, and stiffness, it is important to remember that they can be associated with GI bleeding and cardiotoxicity. For disease that is refractory to NSAIDs and for patients who cannot take NSAIDs, guidelines recommend that a biological medication should be used, such as a TNF inhibitor or an interleukin (IL) 17 inhibitor.<sup>[1,5]</sup></p>

<p>At this time, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for nr-axSpA; however, treatment guidelines by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and also European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) do recommend the use of some treatments indicated for AS for patients with nr-axSpA.<sup>[1,5]</sup> The 5 TNF inhibitors that have demonstrated efficacy for nr-AxSpA and are approved by the FDA to treat AS are<sup>[1]</sup>:</p>

<p>&#8226;	Adalimumab </p>

<p>&#8226;	Certolizumab pegol </p>

<p>&#8226;	Etanercept </p>

<p><a name="_Hlk524618839"></a>&#8226;	Golimumab </p>

<p>&#8226;	Infliximab </p>

<p>Secukinumab is the first IL-17 inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of AS.<sup>[12]</sup> Studies of IL-17 inhibitors in patients with nonradiographic disease are currently underway. Caution should be used when considering IL-17 inhibitors for patients with axSpA who have active IBD or Crohn disease.<sup>[5]</sup> It should also be noted that both TNF inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors can reactivate latent tuberculosis and increase the risk for infection.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p>ACR/SAA/SPARTAN strongly recommend against treatment with systemic glucocorticoids in active AS and active nr-axSpA.<sup>[1]</sup> Limited studies have been done on the treatment of active AS with systemic glucocorticoids, showing modest improvements; however, the sample sizes of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) were small, and the quality of evidence for the case studies was considered low due to risk for bias and imprecision in the effect estimation.<sup>[1,13-16]</sup></p>

<p>The treatment of patients with axSpA should be individualized according to the patient's current condition and disease severity, as well as patient characteristics such as comorbidities and psychosocial factors.<sup>[1,5]</sup> AxSpA is associated with several comorbidities that contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality and add to the complexity of management. These comorbidities include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcers, headaches, depression, uveitis, cancer, IBD, osteoporosis, psoriasis, and other cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and neurological complications.<sup>[6,17,18]</sup> Therefore, it is important to take any presenting comorbidities into account when creating treatment plans, and to refer patients to specialists in a timely manner. </p>

<p>In addition to receiving pharmacologic therapy, patients should be advised to exercise on a regular basis. Home exercises should be recommended to Jason, as they have proven benefit for patients with axSpA.<sup>[19]</sup> Physical therapy is more beneficial than home exercises, but it is more expensive and less feasible than home exercises.<sup>[5,19]</sup> Physical therapy should be considered for each patient and the decision should be made on an individual basis.<sup>[5]</sup> </p>

<p>Patients should be educated about all aspects of managing their disease and be supported to share in decision-making about their treatment.<sup>[1] </sup>Disease monitoring of patients with axSpA in the clinic could include assessment of disease activity, patient-reported outcomes, clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging. The types and frequency of monitoring should be decided on an individual basis depending on symptoms, severity, and treatment regimen.<sup>[5] </sup>To define the level of disease activity, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) or the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) may be used.<sup>[1,5,20,21]</sup> (Figures 2 and 3) In past clinical practice, active disease has been defined as BASDAI score &#8805;4, but active disease can also be defined as ASDAS &#8805;2.1.<sup>[5]</sup> </p>

<p>It has been suggested that the ASDAS is a better measure of disease activity than the BASDAI.<sup>[5,24]</sup> In support of this conclusion, the BASDAI is a fully patient-reported outcome measure, whereas the ASDAS is based on both patient reports and C-reactive protein.<sup>[20,23]</sup> In addition, the ASDAS cut-offs for disease activity states and response criteria were based on a thorough validation process, while the BASDAI cut-offs were chosen arbitrarily. Furthermore, whereas persistently increased ASDAS is associated with syndesmophyte formation, the BASDAI must be combined with CRP measurement to have similar value.<sup>[25]</sup> Although often there is concordance between BASDAI score &#8805;4 and ASDAS &#8805;2.1, in discordant cases, an elevated ASDAS is more predictive of good response than an elevated BASDAI.<sup>[5]</sup> </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 1 Continues</strong></p>

<p>Jason's BASDAI score is 5 and his ASDAS is 2.6. He begins treatment with infliximab 5 mg/kg at baseline, at week 2, at week 6, and then every 6 weeks thereafter and does well. At subsequent follow-ups over the year, his BASDAI score improves to 1.9. One year later, he starts to experience infusion reactions. During his visit, he is symptomatic again, and mentions that his back pain is worsening again. His BASDAI score during this visit is 6.4.</p>

<p>Jason begins treatment with infliximab 5 mg/kg at baseline, at week 2, at week 6, and then every 6 weeks thereafter; he responds well. At subsequent follow-ups over the year, his Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score improves to 1.9. One year later, he starts to experience infusion reactions. During his visit, he is very upset, and with evident disappointment he mentions that his back pain is worsening again. His BASDAI score during this visit is 6.4.</p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> What adjustments should be made to Jason's treatment?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#9633;	Prescribe narcotic analgesics and continue treatment with infliximab at the same dose</p>

<p>&#9633;	Increase the infliximab dose to 7.5 mg every 4 weeks</p>

<p>&#9633;	Switch to ixekizumab</p>

<p>&#9633;	Switch to adalimumab</p>
