        <p>MRI may show signs of inflammation much earlier than radiographs show structural damage. MRI allows early detection of sacroiliac joint inflammation in patients with axSpA.<sup>[9,10]</sup> A gadolinium-enhanced image can detect areas of increased vascularization, helping detect synovitis and enthesitis; however, it does not necessarily add value to the diagnostic capacity of the MRI over STIR or T1 sequences in diagnosing early axSpA.<sup>[9]</sup> During the inflammatory phase, a STIR image will typically show hyperintensity in the bone marrow (termed "bone marrow edema") on both sides of the sacroiliac joints.<sup>[11]</sup> As such, to save time and to reduce patient burden, cost, and risk, gadolinium administration is not needed. </p>
