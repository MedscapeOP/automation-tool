<td><p>After Hispanics, non-Hispanic (NH) blacks are the second largest US racial/ethnic group, making up 13% of the total US population but carrying a disproportionately high cancer and healthcare burden. Compared with other racial or ethnic groups, NH blacks have the highest mortality and lowest survival for most cancers, heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, and other leading causes of death, mostly driven by lower socioeconomic status and inadequate insurance coverage.</p>

<p>Although the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and subsequent Medicaid expansion helped lower the number of uninsured blacks by 50%, coverage gains were lowest among blacks, and the effect of insurance coverage alone on cancer disparities is still unclear. The goals of this report were to summarize data on cancer occurrence among US blacks and to estimate the total number of cancer deaths prevented in this group because of the continuous decline in cancer mortality since the early 1990s.</p>

<td><p>Death rates from cancer among blacks continue to decline, such that the disparity between blacks and whites is narrowing for the most common cancers, and in some age groups, the mortality gap has been almost eliminated, new statistics show.</p>

<p>"In the United States, African American/black individuals bear a disproportionate share of the cancer burden, having the highest death rate and the lowest survival rate of any racial or ethnic group for most cancers," Carol DeSantis, MPH, from the American Cancer Society, and colleagues write. </p>

<p>"[But] twenty-five years of continuous declines in the cancer death rate among black individuals translates to more than 462,000 fewer cancer deaths," they note. "[And the] decline in the black-white cancer mortality disparity is even more striking in some age groups."</p>

<p>The research was published online February 14 in <em>CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians</em>.</p>

<p>The triannual report by researchers from the American Cancer Society (ACS) relies on cancer incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute. Long-term incidence trends were based on data from SEER 9 registries.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"[W]e projected the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths for blacks in the United States in 2019 to provide an estimate of the contemporary cancer burden," DeSantis and colleagues explain. </p>

<p>Rates of cancer deaths overall are basically all trending in the right direction for the black population, as the analysis shows.</p>

<p>In 1990, for example, death from cancer was 47% higher in black men than it was in white men, but in 2016, the cancer mortality rate was only 19% higher in black men. The disparity in cancer death rates between black and white women dropped less dramatically during the same interlude, going from 19% in 1990 to 13% in 2016, the researchers add. </p>

<p>However, among men aged 40 to 49 years, the disparity in the black/white cancer death rate dropped from 102% in 1990 to 1991 to only 17% in 2015 to 2016. "Likewise, among women aged 40 to 49 years, the overall disparity narrowed from 44% in 1990-1991 to 30% in 2015-2016," the researchers note. </p>

<p>In addition, in black women between 80 and 89 years of age, the mortality rate from cancer in 2015 to 2016 was actually 3% lower for black women than it was for white women, they add. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the 5-year survival rate is still lower in blacks than it is for whites for every stage of diagnosis and for most cancers.</p>

<p>This survival gap likely reflects socioeconomic barriers to timely, high-quality medical care among disadvantaged blacks, as the researchers suggest. "Nevertheless, the overall 5-year relative survival rate among blacks has improved from 27% during 1960-1963 to 63% during 2008-2014, compared with an increase in whites from 39% to 70%."</p>

<p><strong>Selected Cancers</strong></p>

<p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting black women, and death rates from breast cancer are still 41% higher in black women than they are among white women. </p>

<p>Five-year survival rates from breast cancer (all stages) are also somewhat lower among black women (81% in the period 2008 to 2014) compared with 91% for white women during the same period. </p>

<p>Among black men, prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer. It is the second-leading cause of death in this racial group, and black men are also more likely to die from prostate cancer than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States, as the authors point out. </p>

<p>Encouragingly, the death rate from prostate cancer among black men has dropped precipitously, falling more than 50% from its peak in 1993 (81.9 deaths per 100,000 men) to just 39.8 deaths per 100,000 men in 2012 to 2016, the researchers note.</p>

<p>Indeed, between 2006 and 2015, mortality from prostate cancer actually decreased faster among black men than among white men, again narrowing the disparity between the 2 ethnic groups in survival outcomes.</p>

<p>Blacks also have the highest rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) of any racial or ethnic group in the United States, a fact that has been true for many decades.</p>

<p>However, between 2006 and 2015, "incidence rates [of CRC] decreased by 2.7% per year among black men and by 2.8% per year among black women, similar to declines in white [men and women]," the researchers note. </p>

<p>And although racial disparities in mortality from CRC between the 2 groups are still large, "from 2007 to 2016, CRC death rates declined faster in blacks than in whites, resulting in a narrowing of the racial disparity among both men and women," the authors observe.</p>

<p>Lung cancer, in turn, is the second most common cancer in both black men and black women, and is a leading cause of cancer death in blacks as well. </p>

<p>However, having peaked in the mid-1980s, the incidence of lung cancer in black men has been steadily declining over time. From 2006 to 2015, lung cancer incidence rates decreased faster in black men and in black women compared with their white counterparts, the researchers observe.</p>

<p>"As a result, the racial disparity in lung cancer death rates among men of all ages has been substantially reduced, from an excess of 40% in 1990-1992 to 18% during 2012-2016," they authors state, adding that this disparity has now been eliminated in people younger than 40 years. </p>

<p>For female-only cancers, cervical cancer rates are still 30% higher in black women than they are in white women. Here again, however, there has been a faster decline in the incidence of cervical cancer among black women than white women, and this steeper decline in cervical cancer incidence rates among black women has again closed the racial mortality gap overall: the gap has now been eliminated in women younger than 50 years, the researchers note.</p>

<p>Last, death by uterine cancer bucked the overall trend in cancer mortality rates, increasing 2.2% in black women between 2007 and 2016 and 1.7% in white women.</p>

<p>In addition, despite similar incidence rates of uterine cancer among black and white women, death rates are still nearly double in black women compared with white women, whereas 5-year survival rates are substantially lower in black women (62%) compared with white women (83%). </p>

<p>"Seeing the substantial progress made over the past several decades in reducing black-white disparities in cancer mortality is incredibly gratifying," Len Lichtenfeld, MD, interim chief medical officer, American Cancer Society, said in a statement.</p>

<p>"To continue this progress, we need to expand access to high-quality cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment for all Americans," he added. </p>

<tr valign="top">
<td><p>&#8226;	Every 3 years, the ACS monitors progress in reducing racial disparities in cancer incidence and mortality by reporting the estimated number of new cancer cases and deaths among blacks.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Using cancer incidence data from the SEER program of the National Cancer Institute, data from SEER 9 registries to determine long-term incidence trends, and additional data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and the National Center for Health Statistics, the ACS reported on US cancer incidence, mortality, survival, screening, and risk factors.</p>

<p>&#8226;	For 2019, the ACS anticipates ~202,260 new cancer cases and 73,030 cancer deaths among US blacks.</p>

<p>&#8226;	From 2006 through 2015, overall cancer incidence rate declined faster in black men than in white men (2.4% vs 1.7%/year), mostly driven by the sharper decrease in lung cancer. </p>

<p>&#8226;	However, the overall cancer incidence rate was stable in black women and increased slightly in white women because rates for cancers of the breast, uterine corpus, and pancreas increased while cancers of the lung and colorectum decreased. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Blacks had faster declines in overall cancer mortality among men (2.6% vs 1.6%/year) and women (1.5% vs 1.3%/year), mostly because of greater declines for cancers of the lung, colorectum, and prostate. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Therefore, the excess risk for overall cancer death in blacks vs whites decreased from 47% in 1990 to 19% in 2016 among men and from 19% to 13% in women. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Among men younger than 50 years and women aged 70 years or older, the black-white cancer disparity has nearly disappeared. </p>

<p>&#8226;	The disparity in the black/white cancer death rate among men aged 40 to 49 years fell from 102% in 1990 to 1991 to 17% in 2015 to 2016.</p>

<p>&#8226;	For women in that age group, the corresponding disparity during that period decreased from 44% to 30%. </p>

<p>&#8226;	In 2015 to 2016, the cancer death rate among women aged 80 to 89 years was actually 3% lower for blacks than for whites. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Overall 5-year relative survival among blacks increased from 27% during 1960 to 1963 to 63% during 2008 to 2014, whereas it increased from 39% to 70% among whites.</p>

<p>&#8226;	At every stage of diagnosis, and for most cancers, 5-year survival is still lower in blacks than it is for whites, most likely because of socioeconomic barriers hindering disadvantaged blacks from receiving timely, high-quality medical care. </p>

<p>&#8226;	The investigators estimate that 25 years of continuous declines in cancer mortality among blacks translates to at least 462,000 fewer cancer deaths. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Among black women, breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer, with mortality 41% higher than in white women, and with lower 5-year survival rates from all stages (81% vs 91% from 2008 to 2014). </p>

<p>&#8226;	Among black men, prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of death, with greater probability of death from prostate cancer than for any other US racial or ethnic group. </p>

<p>&#8226;	However, prostate cancer mortality among blacks has declined by more than half from its highest point in 1993 (81.9 deaths/100,000 men) to 39.8 deaths/100,000 men annually in 2012 through 2016.</p>

<p>&#8226;	The black-white disparity in prostate cancer mortality narrowed between 2006 and 2015, as mortality declined faster in blacks than in whites.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Compared with any other US racial or ethnic group, blacks have long had the highest rates of CRC, but incidence fell between 2006 and 2015 by 2.7% per year in black men and by 2.8% per year in black women, which are similar decreases to those reported in whites. </p>

<p>&#8226;	The black-white disparity in CRC mortality also narrowed between 2007 and 2015, as CRC death rates declined faster in blacks than in whites.</p>

<p>&#8226;	For black men and black women, lung cancer is the second most prevalent cancer and the leading cause of cancer mortality. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Lung cancer incidence in black men peaked in the mid-1980s, and since then has decreased steadily.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Among black men as well as black women, lung cancer incidence rates declined faster from 2006 to 2015 than among white men and women.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Racial disparity in lung cancer mortality among men of all ages therefore declined markedly, going from more than 40% in 1990 to 1992 to 18% in 2012 to 2016, and the disparity for persons younger than 40 years has now disappeared. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Although cervical cancer rates are still 30% higher among blacks than whites, incidence has decreased faster in blacks, and the disparity in cervical cancer mortality has now disappeared in women younger than 50 years.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Uterine cancer incidence rates are similar in blacks and whites, but mortality increased between 2007 and 2016 by 2.2% in blacks and by 1.7% in whites.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Uterine cancer mortality is nearly twice as high in blacks as in whites, and 5-year survival rates are markedly lower (62% vs 83%). </p>

<p>&#8226;	On the basis of their findings, the investigators concluded that blacks still carry a disproportionate share of the cancer burden in the United States, that there has been considerable progress over the last quarter century to reduce this disparity, and that the disparity has been nearly eliminated for some age groups.</p>

<p>&#8226;	However, improving access to high-quality prevention, early detection, and treatment for all Americans will mandate continued progress in reducing disparities. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Study limitations include model-based projections of estimated numbers of new cancer cases and deaths anticipated to occur in 2019, which should be interpreted with caution and should not be used to track trends over time. </p>

<p>1. You are advising a large health maintenance organization regarding anticipated needs for cancer care. On the basis of the American Cancer Society (ACS) report by DeSantis and colleagues, which one of the following statements about overall cancer occurrence among blacks and estimated overall number of cancer deaths prevented in this group since the early 1990s is correct? </p>

<p>A. For 2019, the ACS anticipates ~202,260 new cancer cases and 73,030 cancer deaths among US blacks</p>

<p>B. From 2006 through 2015, overall cancer incidence rate declined faster in black women than in white women</p>

<p>C. Black men, but not black women, had faster declines in overall cancer mortality than their white counterparts</p>

<p>D. The investigators estimate that 25 years of continuous declines in cancer mortality among blacks translates to approximately 250,000 fewer cancer deaths</p>

<p><strong>Correct answer paragraph:</strong> A. From 2006 through 2015, overall cancer incidence rate declined faster in black men than in white men (2.4% vs 1.7% per year), but overall cancer incidence rate was stable in black women and increased slightly in white women. Blacks had faster declines in overall cancer mortality among men (2.6% vs 1.6% per year), as well as women (1.5% vs 1.3% per year). Excess risk for overall cancer death in blacks vs whites decreased from 47% in 1990 to 19% in 2016 among men and from 19% to 13% in women. At every stage of diagnosis and for most cancers, 5-year survival is still lower in blacks than it is for whites, most likely because of socioeconomic barriers hindering disadvantaged blacks from receiving timely, high-quality medical care.

<p>2. According to the ACS report by DeSantis and colleagues, which one of the following statements about incidence and mortality of specific cancers in blacks and in whites in the United States is correct?</p>

<p>A. Breast cancer mortality is 11% higher in black women than in white women</p>

<p>B. Prostate cancer mortality among blacks declined by more than half from its peak in 1993 (81.9 deaths/100,000 men) to 39.8/100,000 annually in 2012 through 2016</p>

<p>C. Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in blacks remained stable between 2006 and 2015</p>

<p>D. Declines in lung cancer incidence and mortality were faster in whites than in blacks</p>
<p><strong>Correct answer paragraph: B. </strong>Among black women, breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer, with mortality 41% higher than in white women, and with lower 5-year survival rates from all stages (81% vs 91% from 2008 to 2014). CRC incidence fell between 2006 and 2015 by 2.7% per year in black men and by 2.8% per year in black women, which are similar decreases to those reported in whites. The black-white disparity in prostate cancer mortality and CRC mortality narrowed between 2006-2007 and 2015, as mortality declined faster in blacks than in whites. Among black men as well as black women, lung cancer incidence rates declined faster from 2006 to 2015 than among white men and women. Racial disparity in lung cancer mortality among men of all ages therefore declined markedly, going from more than 40% in 1990 to 1992 to 18% in 2012 to 2016, and the disparity for persons younger than 40 years has now disappeared. </p>
