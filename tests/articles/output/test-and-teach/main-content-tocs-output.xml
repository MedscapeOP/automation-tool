Thinking back, Jason remembers that even in his late teens he had some sporadic back pain. He first sought treatment for his back pain at the age of 25. There was no injury or identifiable factor or event associated with the pain. At that time, he began treatment with ibuprofen 400 mg taken every 6 hours. This provided him with significant symptom relief. However, after about 5 years, he developed intolerable gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. He switched to naproxen 220 mg BID. This provided relief for a time, but now he reports that it does not adequately control his pain. Jason says that his back pain is worse in the morning and is somewhat relieved after he gets up and moves around. In addition, he says that the pain often disrupts his sleep about 3 or 4 hours into the night. He has sought chiropractic treatment as well as physical therapy for the back pain, but neither resulted in lasting symptom relief (Tables 1 and 2).</p></p></subsec_content><qna_form/></subsec_element><subsec_element><subsec_header><p><strong>Table 1.

<p>Spondyloarthritis (SpA) describes a collection of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases that have overlapping features, including axial and peripheral joint involvement such as sacroiliitis, enthesitis, peripheral inflammatory arthritis, extra-articular manifestations, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positivity, and familial aggregation.<sup type="ref">[1,2]</sup> Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is characterized by involvement of the sacroiliac joints and spine. The diagnosis of axSpA is often delayed, sometimes by as much as 8 years or more.<sup type="ref">[3]</sup> A chief reason for the long diagnostic delay is that sacroiliitis, which is considered a hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), is not clinically detectable and may not be visible on plain x-ray in the early stages of the disease.<sup type="ref">[4]</sup></p><p>There are 2 main types of SpA, axial and peripheral, depending upon the main presenting symptoms. However, the 2 types can overlap, and one may progress to the other. Axial SpA predominantly involves the spine and sacroiliac joints. Peripheral SpA predominantly involves peripheral joints. For classification purposes, axSpA is further divided in radiographic or nonradiographic (Figure 1).<sup type="ref">[2]</sup></p></subsec_content><qna_form/></subsec_element><subsec_element><subsec_header><p><strong>Figure 1. Spectrum of axSpA<sup type="ref">[2]</sup></strong></p></subsec_header><subsec_content><p>An evolving understanding of the concept of axSpA has led to a differentiation between nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) and radiographic axSpA. These 2 terms are distinguished by the degree of sacroiliitis assessed by conventional radiography. Radiographic axSpA, or AS, can be diagnosed only when there is definitive evidence of sacroiliitis on plain radiographs of the sacroiliac.<sup type="ref">[2]</sup></p><p>In clinical practice, it is important to remember that radiographic sacroiliitis is a late finding in the disease course of many patients.<sup type="ref">[5]</sup> Patients can be diagnosed based on a typical clinical pattern, even in the presence of normal radiographs. The leading symptom of axSpA is chronic back pain, which is "inflammatory" in nature, improves with physical activity, and is not relieved by rest. In addition, other musculoskeletal manifestations of axSpA include arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis.<sup type="ref">[5]</sup> Certain typical extra-articular manifestations in a patient should raise the clinical suspicion of axSpA. These can include acute anterior uveitis (AAU), psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<sup type="ref">[5]</sup></p><p>In Jason's case, he has had 3 occurrences of uveitis, which is a common finding in patients with axSpA. In one cross-sectional study of patients with AS, 39% had a history of AAU.<sup type="ref">[6]</sup> In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of AAU was 25.8%.<sup type="ref">[7]</sup> A study of unselected patients presenting with uveitis identified a minimum prevalence of axSpA of 20.2%. Of those patients, 22.9% did not have a previous diagnosis of axSpA.<sup type="ref">[8]</sup></p><p>Crucial elements for a prompt and accurate diagnosis include a comprehensive history of the presenting complaint and past medical history. A timeline of the pain and description of aggravating factors provide clues to the diagnosis. Patients with axSpA typically describe a pattern of pronounced stiffness and improvement of pain and stiffness with activity or exercise.<sup type="ref">[5]</sup></p></subsec_content><qna_form/></subsec_element></sec_element><sec_element><sec_header><p>Case 1 Continues</p></sec_header><subsec_element><subsec_header/><subsec_content><p>An x-ray of the sacroiliac joint shows no evidence of sacroiliitis.

Although these are effective in reducing inflammation, pain, and stiffness, it is important to remember that they can be associated with GI bleeding and cardiotoxicity. For disease that is refractory to NSAIDs and for patients who cannot take NSAIDs, guidelines recommend that a biological medication should be used, such as a TNF inhibitor or an interleukin (IL) 17 inhibitor.<sup type="ref">[1,5]</sup></p><p>At this time, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for nr-axSpA; however, treatment guidelines by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and also European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) do recommend the use of some treatments indicated for AS for patients with nr-axSpA.<sup type="ref">[1,5]</sup> The 5 TNF inhibitors that have demonstrated efficacy for nr-AxSpA and are approved by the FDA to treat AS are<sup type="ref">[1]</sup>:</p><p>‚Ä¢	Adalimumab </p><p>‚Ä¢	Certolizumab pegol </p><p>‚Ä¢	Etanercept </p><p>‚Ä¢	Golimumab </p><p>‚Ä¢	Infliximab </p><p>Secukinumab is the first IL-17 inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of AS.<sup type="ref">[12]</sup> Studies of IL-17 inhibitors in patients with nonradiographic disease are currently underway. Caution should be used when considering IL-17 inhibitors for patients with axSpA who have active IBD or Crohn disease.<sup type="ref">[5]</sup> It should also be noted that both TNF inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors can reactivate latent tuberculosis and increase the risk for infection.<sup type="ref">[1]</sup></p><p>ACR/SAA/SPARTAN strongly recommend against treatment with systemic glucocorticoids in active AS and active nr-axSpA.<sup type="ref">[1]</sup> Limited studies have been done on the treatment of active AS with systemic glucocorticoids, showing modest improvements; however, the sample sizes of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) were small, and the quality of evidence for the case studies was considered low due to risk for bias and imprecision in the effect estimation.<sup type="ref">[1,13-16]</sup></p><p>The treatment of patients with axSpA should be individualized according to the patient's current condition and disease severity, as well as patient characteristics such as comorbidities and psychosocial factors.<sup type="ref">[1,5]</sup> AxSpA is associated with several comorbidities that contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality and add to the complexity of management. These comorbidities include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcers, headaches, depression, uveitis, cancer, IBD, osteoporosis, psoriasis, and other cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and neurological complications.<sup type="ref">[6,17,18]</sup> Therefore, it is important to take any presenting comorbidities into account when creating treatment plans, and to refer patients to specialists in a timely manner. </p><p>In addition to receiving pharmacologic therapy, patients should be advised to exercise on a regular basis. Home exercises should be recommended to Jason, as they have proven benefit for patients with axSpA.<sup type="ref">[19]</sup> Physical therapy is more beneficial than home exercises, but it is more expensive and less feasible than home exercises.<sup type="ref">[5,19]</sup> Physical therapy should be considered for each patient and the decision should be made on an individual basis.<sup type="ref">[5]</sup></p><p>Patients should be educated about all aspects of managing their disease and be supported to share in decision-making about their treatment.<sup type="ref">[1] </sup>Disease monitoring of patients with axSpA in the clinic could include assessment of disease activity, patient-reported outcomes, clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging. The types and frequency of monitoring should be decided on an individual basis depending on symptoms, severity, and treatment regimen.<sup type="ref">[5] </sup>To define the level of disease activity, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) or the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) may be used.<sup type="ref">[1,5,20,21]</sup> (Figures 2 and 3) In past clinical practice, active disease has been defined as BASDAI score ‚â•4, but active disease can also be defined as ASDAS ‚â•2.1.<sup type="ref">[5]</sup></p><p><strong>Figure 2.
