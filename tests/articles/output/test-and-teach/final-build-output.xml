Consequently, dermatologists often care for patients in whom the risk for comorbidities has not yet been identified. Therefore, they play an important role in early detection and determining the course regarding further treatment of their patients’ comorbidities.<sup type="ref">[38] </sup>Knowledge and early initiation of treatment for comorbidities are also essential with respect to the initiation of adequate systemic psoriasis therapy.

Thus, simplified, guideline-oriented referral of patients with risks for comorbidities to the appropriate specialist is important.<sup type="ref">[38] </sup></p><p>For patients with psoriasis and comorbid IBD, it is therefore considered adequate for a dermatologist to take an appropriate medical history and conduct a clinical examination, and then to refer the patient to a gastroenterologist without performing additional diagnostic tests.<sup type="ref">[39] </sup>Furthermore, psoriasis is usually treated with medications that may interfere with some comorbidities, mainly through their adverse effects. Therefore, in order to address the comprehensive management of psoriasis and its comorbidities, it is critical to establish the dermatologist’s role in the diagnosis of psoriasis comorbidities and the criteria for referral to the appropriate specialist.<sup type="ref">[39]</sup></p><p>Patients with psoriasis and suspected IBD should be referred to a gastroenterologist if any of the following symptoms are present<sup type="ref">[39]</sup>: </p><p>•	Chronic diarrhea (&gt; 4 weeks)</p><p>•	Blood in stools</p><p>•	Rectal pain or bleeding</p><p>•	Bowel urgency</p><p>•	Rectal tenesmus</p><p>•	Chronic abdominal cramps or pain (&gt; 4 weeks)</p><p>Psoriasis and IBD can have profound and debilitating effects on the lives of patients, both at the physical and the psychosocial levels. As such, a concerted, patient-centered, multidisciplinary team approach to disease management for these conditions can help to encourage treatment adherence, improve outcomes, and enhance QoL for these patients. This multidisciplinary team approach involves the discussion of treatment options with both gastroenterologists and dermatologists as early as possible.<sup type="ref">[40]</sup></p><p><strong><p>Christina was referred to a gastroenterologist, who confirmed a diagnosis of CD based on the results of imaging and laboratory tests, along with her history and clinical presentation. </p></strong></p></subsec_content><qna_form/></subsec_element></sec_element><sec_element><sec_header><p>&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Level 1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Clinical Case 1: Patient History</p></sec_header><subsec_element><subsec_header/><subsec_content><table style="margin-right: 20px;" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#b3b3b3" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><img src="/webmd/professional_assets/medscape/images/content/article/902/362/902362-patientNaN.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none--AMPERSAND--amp;resize=200:150" alt="" border="0" width="200"/></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="min-height: 230px;"><p>Christina is a 35-year-old laboratory technician with a 5-year history of plaque psoriasis.

In one UK study, major depression contributed to a 10-fold increased risk for suicide among patients with psoriasis.<sup type="ref">[100,103]</sup> Moreover, depression in patients with psoriasis may reduce adherence to treatment, resulting in more severe disease and more depression.<sup type="ref">[104]</sup> Therefore, managing depression may improve both treatment adherence and patient outcomes. </p><p>Although many dermatologists acknowledge that the risk for depression and suicidality exists among patients with psoriasis, few take any action to address the issue.<sup type="ref">[105]</sup> This highlights the need for appropriate screening methods in practice, in order to encourage early identification and treatment of depression among this patient population. For example, a thorough discussion of the patient's answers to the DLQI and Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) is essential for understanding how psoriasis affects the patient's life, as well as for determining the best course of treatment to improve the patient's QoL.

Treating nail involvement in psoriasis is important for improving patients’ health outcomes and QoL.<sup type="ref">[111,112]</sup> The treatment pf nail psoriasis is challenging because of the slow disease resolution in response to therapy, which is related to the slow rate of nail growth. Indeed, clinical improvements in nail disease typically lag behind those in skin disease, but efficacy in nail psoriasis can be observed at 12 weeks, with additional improvements or even completely normal nails seen at 1 year.<sup type="ref">[113]</sup> Numerous studies have shown that conventional therapies, such as MTX and cyclosporine, are likely to be less effective and slower-acting than biologics in treating nail disease.

Joint damage may develop in the first years of the PsA course, with even a 6-month diagnostic delay contributing to worse long-term radiographic and functional outcomes.<sup type="ref">[131]</sup> Therefore, dermatologists play a pivotal role in the early identification of patients with PsA and in the prevention of irreversible joint damage.<sup type="ref">[132,133]</sup></p><p>Early recognition of PsA by dermatologists may provide an opportunity to improve patients’ outcomes through close cooperation with a rheumatologist. Patients should be questioned about joint pain, stiffness, and swelling at every visit, and the findings should be documented to include the onset and duration of symptoms.<sup type="ref">[134-136]</sup></p><p>Driven by the need for early identification and treatment of PsA, a number of screening tools have been developed and validated.<sup type="ref">[137,138]</sup> According to an expert consensus aimed at guiding dermatologists in the management of patients with PsA in their clinical practices, the most useful screening tools include the Psoriatic Arthritis Screening Evaluation (PASE), the Psoriasis Epidemiological Screening Trial (PEST), the Early ARthritis Psoriatic (EARP) questionnaire, and the Psoriatic Arthritis Screening (SiPAS) questionnaire.<sup type="ref">[132]</sup> All of these screening tools should be administered by dermatologists at the initial diagnosis of psoriasis and periodically thereafter in patients’ follow-up visits. </p><p>Differentiating inflammatory from noninflammatory arthritis symptoms is an important clinical aspect that can guide the dermatologist in determining whether to screen and refer a patient with psoriasis and possible PsA to a rheumatologist. A simple screening mnemonic, “PSA,” has been established to remind dermatologists and other clinicians of the most basic clinical features that distinguish inflammatory from noninflammatory arthritis (<strong>Table 5</strong>). The presence of 2 out of 3 of these features should prompt the use of a formal validated screening tool and/or referral to a rheumatologist for evaluation.<sup type="ref">[139]</sup></p></subsec_content><qna_form/></subsec_element><subsec_element><subsec_header><strong>Table 5.
