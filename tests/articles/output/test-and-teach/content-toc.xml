Thinking back, Jason remembers that even in his late teens he had some sporadic back pain. He first sought treatment for his back pain at the age of 25. There was no injury or identifiable factor or event associated with the pain. At that time, he began treatment with ibuprofen 400 mg taken every 6 hours. This provided him with significant symptom relief. However, after about 5 years, he developed intolerable gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. He switched to naproxen 220 mg BID. This provided relief for a time, but now he reports that it does not adequately control his pain. Jason says that his back pain is worse in the morning and is somewhat relieved after he gets up and moves around. In addition, he says that the pain often disrupts his sleep about 3 or 4 hours into the night. He has sought chiropractic treatment as well as physical therapy for the back pain, but neither resulted in lasting symptom relief (Tables 1 and 2).</p></p></subsec_content><qna_form/></subsec_element><subsec_element><subsec_header><p>Discussion</p></subsec_header><subsec_content><p>Spondyloarthritis (SpA) describes a collection of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases that have overlapping features, including axial and peripheral joint involvement such as sacroiliitis, enthesitis, peripheral inflammatory arthritis, extra-articular manifestations, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positivity, and familial aggregation.<sup type="ref">[1,2]</sup> Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is characterized by involvement of the sacroiliac joints and spine. The diagnosis of axSpA is often delayed, sometimes by as much as 8 years or more.<sup type="ref">[3]</sup> A chief reason for the long diagnostic delay is that sacroiliitis, which is considered a hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), is not clinically detectable and may not be visible on plain x-ray in the early stages of the disease.<sup type="ref">[4]</sup></p><p>There are 2 main types of SpA, axial and peripheral, depending upon the main presenting symptoms. However, the 2 types can overlap, and one may progress to the other. Axial SpA predominantly involves the spine and sacroiliac joints. Peripheral SpA predominantly involves peripheral joints. For classification purposes, axSpA is further divided in radiographic or nonradiographic (Figure 1).<sup type="ref">[2]</sup></p></subsec_content><qna_form/></subsec_element><subsec_element><subsec_header><p><strong>Figure 1. Spectrum of axSpA<sup type="ref">[2]</sup></strong></p></subsec_header><subsec_content><p>An evolving understanding of the concept of axSpA has led to a differentiation between nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) and radiographic axSpA. These 2 terms are distinguished by the degree of sacroiliitis assessed by conventional radiography. Radiographic axSpA, or AS, can be diagnosed only when there is definitive evidence of sacroiliitis on plain radiographs of the sacroiliac.<sup type="ref">[2]</sup></p><p>In clinical practice, it is important to remember that radiographic sacroiliitis is a late finding in the disease course of many patients.<sup type="ref">[5]</sup>
Patients can be diagnosed based on a typical clinical pattern, even in the presence of normal radiographs. The leading symptom of axSpA is chronic back pain, which is
"inflammatory" in nature, improves with physical activity, and is not relieved by rest. In addition, other musculoskeletal manifestations of axSpA include arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis.<sup type="ref">[5]</sup> Certain typical extra-articular manifestations in a patient should raise the clinical suspicion of axSpA. These can include acute anterior uveitis (AAU), psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<sup type="ref">[5]</sup></p><p>In Jason's case, he has had 3 occurrences of uveitis, which is a common finding in patients with axSpA. In one cross-sectional study of patients with AS, 39% had a
history of AAU.<sup type="ref">[6]</sup> In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of AAU was 25.8%.<sup type="ref">[7]</sup> A study of unselected patients presenting with uveitis identified a minimum prevalence of axSpA of 20.2%. Of those patients, 22.9% did not have a previous diagnosis of axSpA.<sup type="ref">[8]</sup></p><p>Crucial elements for a prompt and accurate diagnosis include a comprehensive history of the presenting complaint and past medical history. A timeline of the pain and description of aggravating factors provide clues to the diagnosis. Patients with axSpA typically describe a pattern of pronounced stiffness and improvement of pain and stiffness with activity or exercise.<sup type="ref">[5]</sup></p></subsec_content><qna_form/></subsec_element><subsec_element><subsec_header><p>Discussion</p></subsec_header><subsec_content><p>Infusion reactions to infliximab can happen at any time during treatment, even in patients who have previously tolerated treatment.<sup type="ref">[26]</sup> However, in a prospective analysis of patients enrolled in a community registry, infusion reactions to infliximab were uncommon and were typically classified as mild to moderate.<sup type="ref">[27]</sup> Over the 7-year analysis of 1632 patients, 63.1% were treated for rheumatologic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, AS, or psoriatic arthritis. The most common infusion reactions were pruritus (19.9%), flushing (9.9%), and dyspnea (6.2%). About two-thirds of infusion reactions were observed during the first year of therapy. </p><p>Recent analyses and several guidelines recommend that switching TNF inhibitors can be beneficial in a number of patients with axSpA who have a secondary loss of response to initial TNF inhibitor therapy.<sup type="ref">[1,5,28]</sup> In Europe, TNF inhibitors are indicated for axSpA, including nonradiographic disease, as long as there is evidence of active inflammation. In the United States, the indication is currently limited to AS.<sup type="ref">[29-32]</sup></p><p>Adalimumab is currently indicated for AS and is recommended for nr-axSpA based on data from clinical trials.<sup type="ref">[5]</sup> However, it is not a specifically approved indication in the United States.<sup type="ref">[29]</sup></p><p>In the randomized, controlled ABILITY-1 trial, adalimumab had a positive benefit-risk profile in patients with active nr-axSpA.<sup type="ref">[33]</sup> Greater improvements in disease activity, physical function, and health-related quality of life, as well as reduction of sacroiliac joint and spine inflammation, based on MRI findings were demonstrated after 12 weeks of adalimumab therapy compared with placebo (Table 3). In the open-label ABILITY-1 extension, patients with nr-axSpA had sustained clinical and functional improvements through 3 years, as well as suppression of MRI axial inflammation, which was greater in patients who achieved clinical remission.<sup type="ref">[34]</sup> The safety profile was consistent with what has been observed with adalimumab in AS and other diseases.<sup type="ref">[33]</sup></p><p>There are several other TNF inhibitors that are currently approved for the indication of nr-axSpA in Europe and other countries, but not in the United States. These include certolizumab, etanercept, and golimumab. Data from several recent clinical trials have demonstrated good efficacy and safety profiles for these agents for nr-axSpA (Table 3).</p></subsec_content><qna_form/></subsec_element><subsec_element><subsec_header><p><strong>Table 3.
