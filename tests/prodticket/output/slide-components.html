<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Emerging Approaches for Preventive Therapy of CM</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; CM: Features and Challenges</strong><sup><strong>[6,36,37]</strong></sup></p>

&#8226;	CM and EM are clinically, functionally, and anatomically differentiated

<tt>o	</tt>Evidence suggests they may be separate conditions

&#8226;	Patients with CM usually have more comorbid conditions and more frequent medication overuse

<tt>o	</tt>Complicates clinical management of CM

&#8226;	Estimated rate of reversion from CM to EM is relatively low

<tt>o	</tt>Studies report remission rates of about 15% to 26%

&#8226;	Several mAbs targeting CGRP are in development

<tt>o	</tt>The first was recently approved for migraine prevention

&lt;&lt;insert slide 3&gt;&gt;

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Fremanezumab for Prevention of CM: HALO-CM</strong><sup><strong>[22]</strong></sup></p>

&#8226;	Study looked at reversion of patients with CM to EM with fremanezumab treatment

&#8226;	Fremanezumab is a CGRP mAb that can be given as a monthly or quarterly injection for prevention of migraine

<tt>o	</tt>In clinical trials, shown to significantly reduce frequency of migraine and headache without serious treatment-related adverse events

&#8226;	Phase 3 HALO-CM study

<tt>o	</tt>Patients aged 18 to 70 years with history of migraine for at least 12 months and who met International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-3 criteria for CM

<tt>o	</tt>Randomly assigned to fremanezumab given monthly or quarterly or placebo

<tt>o	</tt>Patients kept a daily diary and completed other questionnaires at regular intervals

&#8226;	Primary endpoint was mean change in the monthly average number of headache days of at least moderate severity at 12 weeks vs baseline

<tt>o	</tt>Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability measures

&#8226;	Study met all of its endpoints

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Reversion From CM to EM With Fremanezumab in HALO-CM</strong><sup><strong>[38]</strong></sup></p>

&#8226;	Post hoc analysis of HALO-CM data looked at proportion of patients who reverted from CM to EM

<tt>o	</tt>Met primary outcome

&#8226;	Fremanezumab demonstrated efficacy as a preventive treatment for CM

<tt>o	</tt>Decrease in mean MHD over the treatment period

&#8226;	Demonstrated potential benefit for reversion from CM to EM

&lt;&lt;insert slide 5&gt;&gt;

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Eptinezumab for Prevention of CM: PROMISE-2</strong><sup><strong>[21]</strong></sup></p>

&#8226;	PROMISE-2 study of the CGRP-targeting mAb eptinezumab as a preventive therapy for CM

<tt>o	</tt>Randomly assigned to a single quarterly infusion of 100 mg or 300 mg dose of eptinezumab or placebo

<tt>o	</tt>Enrolled more than 1000 patients who had approximately 16 monthly migraine days at baseline

&#8226;	Subjects in both eptinezumab groups had a greater reduction in monthly migraine days vs placebo

&#8226;	Study also met secondary endpoints

<tt>o	</tt>More than half of subjects achieved &gt;50% reduction in MMD from weeks 1 to 12 and at monthly intervals

<tt>o	</tt>Significantly higher proportion of patients on eptinezumab achieved 100% reduction in monthly migraine days vs placebo
