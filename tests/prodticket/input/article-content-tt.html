<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 1: Patient Presentation and Background</strong></p>

<p>Jason is a 37-year-old male with progressively worsening lower back pain. Thinking back, Jason remembers that even in his late teens he had some sporadic back pain. He first sought treatment for his back pain at the age of 25. There was no injury or identifiable factor or event associated with the pain. At that time, he began treatment with ibuprofen 400 mg taken every 6 hours. This provided him with significant symptom relief. However, after about 5 years, he developed intolerable gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. He switched to naproxen 220 mg BID. This provided relief for a time, but now he reports that it does not adequately control his pain. Jason says that his back pain is worse in the morning and is somewhat relieved after he gets up and moves around. In addition, he says that the pain often disrupts his sleep about 3 or 4 hours into the night. He has sought chiropractic treatment as well as physical therapy for the back pain, but neither resulted in lasting symptom relief (Tables 1 and 2).</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Based on Jason's medical history and physical examination results, what is your clinical diagnosis? </p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#9633;	Reactive arthritis</p>

<p>&#9633;	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)</p>

<p>&#9633;	Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>Several factors in Jason's case raise the strong clinical suspicion of axSpA: progressively worsening back pain with insidious onset as a teenager, pain improvement with activity and worsening with rest, sleep disturbance, and good response to treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Furthermore, the history of uveitis, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendonitis are strong indicators of immune-mediated inflammatory rheumatic disease.</p>


<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1">
<tr valign="top">
<td><p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Discussion</strong> </p>
BEGIN---
<p>Spondyloarthritis (SpA) describes a collection of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases that have overlapping features, including axial and peripheral joint involvement such as sacroiliitis, enthesitis, peripheral inflammatory arthritis, extra-articular manifestations, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positivity, and familial aggregation.<sup>[1,2]</sup> Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is characterized by involvement of the sacroiliac joints and spine. The diagnosis of axSpA is often delayed, sometimes by as much as 8 years or more.<sup>[3]</sup> A chief reason for the long diagnostic delay is that sacroiliitis, which is considered a hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), is not clinically detectable and may not be visible on plain x-ray in the early stages of the disease.<sup>[4]</sup></p>

<p>There are 2 main types of SpA, axial and peripheral, depending upon the main presenting symptoms. However, the 2 types can overlap, and one may progress to the other. Axial SpA predominantly involves the spine and sacroiliac joints. Peripheral SpA predominantly involves peripheral joints. For classification purposes, axSpA is further divided in radiographic or nonradiographic (Figure 1).<sup>[2]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert figure 1&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> <strong>Spectrum of axSpA<sup>[2]</sup></strong></p>

<p><strong><img height="257" width="435" src="Rheum%20TT%20Deodhar%20243925-01%20v404.jpg" 	alt="Rheum%20TT%20Deodhar%20243925-01%20v404.jpg" border="0" ></strong></p>

<p>An evolving understanding of the concept of axSpA has led to a differentiation between nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) and radiographic axSpA. These 2 terms are distinguished by the degree of sacroiliitis assessed by conventional radiography. Radiographic axSpA, or AS, can be diagnosed only when there is definitive evidence of sacroiliitis on plain radiographs of the sacroiliac.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

<p>In clinical practice, it is important to remember that radiographic sacroiliitis is a late finding in the disease course of many patients.<sup>[5]</sup> Patients can be diagnosed based on a typical clinical pattern, even in the presence of normal radiographs. The leading symptom of axSpA is chronic back pain, which is "inflammatory" in nature, improves with physical activity, and is not relieved by rest. In addition, other musculoskeletal manifestations of axSpA include arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis.<sup>[5]</sup> Certain typical extra-articular manifestations in a patient should raise the clinical suspicion of axSpA. These can include acute anterior uveitis (AAU), psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<sup>[5]</sup></p>

<p>In Jason's case, he has had 3 occurrences of uveitis, which is a common finding in patients with axSpA. In one cross-sectional study of patients with AS, 39% had a history of AAU.<sup>[6]</sup> In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of AAU was 25.8%.<sup>[7]</sup> A study of unselected patients presenting with uveitis identified a minimum prevalence of axSpA of 20.2%. Of those patients, 22.9% did not have a previous diagnosis of axSpA.<sup>[8]</sup></p>

<p>Crucial elements for a prompt and accurate diagnosis include a comprehensive history of the presenting complaint and past medical history. A timeline of the pain and description of aggravating factors provide clues to the diagnosis. Patients with axSpA typically describe a pattern of pronounced stiffness and improvement of pain and stiffness with activity or exercise.<sup>[5]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 1 Continues </strong></p>

<p>An x-ray of the sacroiliac joint shows no evidence of sacroiliitis. Testing for HLA-B27 is positive.</p>

<p>Linked learning/Performance Linked learning Impact Report question</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Which of the following would be the most efficient way to confirm the diagnosis of nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA)?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#9633;	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine</p>

<p>&#9633;	X-ray of the thoracic spine to look for syndesmophytes </p>

<p>&#9633;	MRI of the sacroiliac joints with gadolinium</p>

<p>&#9633;	MRI of the sacroiliac joints without gadolinium</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>An MRI of the sacroiliac joints will confirm the diagnosis, but gadolinium is unnecessary. It is important to ask for a T1-weighted image and a fat-suppressed T2 weighted image (short tau inversion recovery [STIR] sequence). The expense and side effects associated with gadolinium should be avoided, as a gadolinium-enhanced image does not help with diagnosis over and above the T1 and STIR images.<sup>[9]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion</strong></p>

<p>MRI may show signs of inflammation much earlier than radiographs show structural damage. MRI allows early detection of sacroiliac joint inflammation in patients with axSpA.<sup>[9,10]</sup> A gadolinium-enhanced image can detect areas of increased vascularization, helping detect synovitis and enthesitis; however, it does not necessarily add value to the diagnostic capacity of the MRI over STIR or T1 sequences in diagnosing early axSpA.<sup>[9]</sup> During the inflammatory phase, a STIR image will typically show hyperintensity in the bone marrow (termed "bone marrow edema") on both sides of the sacroiliac joints.<sup>[11]</sup> As such, to save time and to reduce patient burden, cost, and risk, gadolinium administration is not needed. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 1 Continues</strong></p>

<p>MRI of the sacroiliac joints is obtained. The T1-weighted image shows some evidence of erosions and sclerosis, and the STIR image shows evidence of bone marrow edema at the inferior corner of the iliac and the sacral side of the joint. Based on these imaging findings, the diagnosis of nr-axSpA is confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p>Jason is a 37-year-old man with progressively worsening lower back pain. His initial regimen when he first sought treatment at age 25 was ibuprofen 400 mg every 6 hours , which provided significant symptom relief. However, intolerable gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects after about 5 years of ibuprofen use prompted a switch to naproxen 220 mg BID. This provided relief for a time, but no longer adequately controls his pain. Jason reports his back pain is worse in the morning but is somewhat relieved with movement. Also, his back pain disrupts his sleep about 3 or 4 hours into the night. Neither chiropractic treatment nor physical therapy has resulted in lasting symptom relief. Based on workup and MRI scan findings, a diagnosis of nr-axSpA is confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> According to American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of America (SAA)/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN) guidelines, which of the following is the next best step for Jason?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#9633;	Increase the NSAID dose and add physical therapy</p>

<p>&#9633;	Start a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, since he has active disease refractory to NSAIDs</p>

<p>&#9633;	Start treatment with sulfasalazine </p>

<p>&#9633;	Start prednisone 1 mg/kg/d for 10 days, followed by tapering therapy over 1 month</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>First-line treatment for nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) typically include NSAIDs and physical therapy. However, Jason currently has active disease that is refractory to NSAIDs. In such cases, the ACR/SAA/SPARTAN advise the use of a TNF inhibitor. Based on a very low to moderate level of evidence of small or no clinical effects, the ACR/SAA/SPARTAN recommends against the use of slow-acting antirheumatic drugs (SAARDs) in most patients whose AS remained active despite NSAID use. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion </strong></p>

<p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first-line treatment for nr-axSpA. Although these are effective in reducing inflammation, pain, and stiffness, it is important to remember that they can be associated with GI bleeding and cardiotoxicity. For disease that is refractory to NSAIDs and for patients who cannot take NSAIDs, guidelines recommend that a biological medication should be used, such as a TNF inhibitor or an interleukin (IL) 17 inhibitor.<sup>[1,5]</sup></p>

<p>At this time, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for nr-axSpA; however, treatment guidelines by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and also European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) do recommend the use of some treatments indicated for AS for patients with nr-axSpA.<sup>[1,5]</sup> The 5 TNF inhibitors that have demonstrated efficacy for nr-AxSpA and are approved by the FDA to treat AS are<sup>[1]</sup>:</p>

<p>&#8226;	Adalimumab </p>

<p>&#8226;	Certolizumab pegol </p>

<p>&#8226;	Etanercept </p>

<p><a name="_Hlk524618839"></a>&#8226;	Golimumab </p>

<p>&#8226;	Infliximab </p>

<p>Secukinumab is the first IL-17 inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of AS.<sup>[12]</sup> Studies of IL-17 inhibitors in patients with nonradiographic disease are currently underway. Caution should be used when considering IL-17 inhibitors for patients with axSpA who have active IBD or Crohn disease.<sup>[5]</sup> It should also be noted that both TNF inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors can reactivate latent tuberculosis and increase the risk for infection.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p>ACR/SAA/SPARTAN strongly recommend against treatment with systemic glucocorticoids in active AS and active nr-axSpA.<sup>[1]</sup> Limited studies have been done on the treatment of active AS with systemic glucocorticoids, showing modest improvements; however, the sample sizes of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) were small, and the quality of evidence for the case studies was considered low due to risk for bias and imprecision in the effect estimation.<sup>[1,13-16]</sup></p>

<p>The treatment of patients with axSpA should be individualized according to the patient's current condition and disease severity, as well as patient characteristics such as comorbidities and psychosocial factors.<sup>[1,5]</sup> AxSpA is associated with several comorbidities that contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality and add to the complexity of management. These comorbidities include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcers, headaches, depression, uveitis, cancer, IBD, osteoporosis, psoriasis, and other cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and neurological complications.<sup>[6,17,18]</sup> Therefore, it is important to take any presenting comorbidities into account when creating treatment plans, and to refer patients to specialists in a timely manner. </p>

<p>In addition to receiving pharmacologic therapy, patients should be advised to exercise on a regular basis. Home exercises should be recommended to Jason, as they have proven benefit for patients with axSpA.<sup>[19]</sup> Physical therapy is more beneficial than home exercises, but it is more expensive and less feasible than home exercises.<sup>[5,19]</sup> Physical therapy should be considered for each patient and the decision should be made on an individual basis.<sup>[5]</sup> </p>

<p>Patients should be educated about all aspects of managing their disease and be supported to share in decision-making about their treatment.<sup>[1] </sup>Disease monitoring of patients with axSpA in the clinic could include assessment of disease activity, patient-reported outcomes, clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging. The types and frequency of monitoring should be decided on an individual basis depending on symptoms, severity, and treatment regimen.<sup>[5] </sup>To define the level of disease activity, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) or the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) may be used.<sup>[1,5,20,21]</sup> (Figures 2 and 3) In past clinical practice, active disease has been defined as BASDAI score &#8805;4, but active disease can also be defined as ASDAS &#8805;2.1.<sup>[5]</sup> </p>

<p>It has been suggested that the ASDAS is a better measure of disease activity than the BASDAI.<sup>[5,24]</sup> In support of this conclusion, the BASDAI is a fully patient-reported outcome measure, whereas the ASDAS is based on both patient reports and C-reactive protein.<sup>[20,23]</sup> In addition, the ASDAS cut-offs for disease activity states and response criteria were based on a thorough validation process, while the BASDAI cut-offs were chosen arbitrarily. Furthermore, whereas persistently increased ASDAS is associated with syndesmophyte formation, the BASDAI must be combined with CRP measurement to have similar value.<sup>[25]</sup> Although often there is concordance between BASDAI score &#8805;4 and ASDAS &#8805;2.1, in discordant cases, an elevated ASDAS is more predictive of good response than an elevated BASDAI.<sup>[5]</sup> </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 1 Continues</strong></p>

<p>Jason's BASDAI score is 5 and his ASDAS is 2.6. He begins treatment with infliximab 5 mg/kg at baseline, at week 2, at week 6, and then every 6 weeks thereafter and does well. At subsequent follow-ups over the year, his BASDAI score improves to 1.9. One year later, he starts to experience infusion reactions. During his visit, he is symptomatic again, and mentions that his back pain is worsening again. His BASDAI score during this visit is 6.4.</p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p>Jason begins treatment with infliximab 5 mg/kg at baseline, at week 2, at week 6, and then every 6 weeks thereafter; he responds well. At subsequent follow-ups over the year, his Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score improves to 1.9. One year later, he starts to experience infusion reactions. During his visit, he is very upset, and with evident disappointment he mentions that his back pain is worsening again. His BASDAI score during this visit is 6.4.</p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> What adjustments should be made to Jason's treatment?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#9633;	Prescribe narcotic analgesics and continue treatment with infliximab at the same dose</p>

<p>&#9633;	Increase the infliximab dose to 7.5 mg every 4 weeks</p>

<p>&#9633;	Switch to ixekizumab</p>

<p>&#9633;	Switch to adalimumab</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>Jason is experiencing a late infusion reaction, as well as diminishing efficacy of infliximab treatment. Per current guidelines, after "secondary" failure of an initial TNF inhibitor, Jason should switch to a second TNF inhibitor. At this time, ixekizumab has not yet been approved for the treatment of axSpA, so it would not be the best choice for Jason based on current evidence. Narcotic analgesics are to be avoided in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as active axSpA as long as possible, because of their potential of being habit-forming.</p>

<p><a name="_Hlk522954027"></a><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt;</strong><strong> Discussion</strong></p>

<p>Infusion reactions to infliximab can happen at any time during treatment, even in patients who have previously tolerated treatment.<sup>[26]</sup> However, in a prospective analysis of patients enrolled in a community registry, infusion reactions to infliximab were uncommon and were typically classified as mild to moderate.<sup>[27]</sup> Over the 7-year analysis of 1632 patients, 63.1% were treated for rheumatologic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, AS, or psoriatic arthritis. The most common infusion reactions were pruritus (19.9%), flushing (9.9%), and dyspnea (6.2%). About two-thirds of infusion reactions were observed during the first year of therapy. </p>

<p>Recent analyses and several guidelines recommend that switching TNF inhibitors can be beneficial in a number of patients with axSpA who have a secondary loss of response to initial TNF inhibitor therapy.<sup>[1,5,28]</sup> In Europe, TNF inhibitors are indicated for axSpA, including nonradiographic disease, as long as there is evidence of active inflammation. In the United States, the indication is currently limited to AS.<sup>[29-32]</sup> </p>

<p>Adalimumab is currently indicated for AS and is recommended for nr-axSpA based on data from clinical trials.<sup>[5]</sup> However, it is not a specifically approved indication in the United States.<sup>[29]</sup></p>

<p>In the randomized, controlled ABILITY-1 trial, adalimumab had a positive benefit-risk profile in patients with active nr-axSpA.<sup>[33]</sup> Greater improvements in disease activity, physical function, and health-related quality of life, as well as reduction of sacroiliac joint and spine inflammation, based on MRI findings were demonstrated after 12 weeks of adalimumab therapy compared with placebo (Table 3). In the open-label ABILITY-1 extension, patients with nr-axSpA had sustained clinical and functional improvements through 3 years, as well as suppression of MRI axial inflammation, which was greater in patients who achieved clinical remission.<sup>[34]</sup> The safety profile was consistent with what has been observed with adalimumab in AS and other diseases.<sup>[33]</sup></p>

<p>There are several other TNF inhibitors that are currently approved for the indication of nr-axSpA in Europe and other countries, but not in the United States. These include certolizumab, etanercept, and golimumab. Data from several recent clinical trials have demonstrated good efficacy and safety profiles for these agents for nr-axSpA (Table 3).</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 2: Patient Presentation and Background</strong></p>

<p>Laura is a 41-year-old woman who has been referred to rheumatology for chronic back pain. She presents today with a swollen R ankle. It was initially blamed on a fall when she was carrying a laundry basket up the stairs, but that injury occurred 3 weeks ago. She has treated the ankle with rest, ice, and elevation, but the symptoms have not improved. She reports that this is not the first time that she has had problems with pain and swelling in her right ankle. In fact, she says, it has been a problem on and off since she was 18 or 19 years old. Laura also has a history of progressively worsening back pain. She has had this back pain since the age of 23, first experiencing it after a caesarean section. An x-ray of the lumbar spine was done at age 26, and was normal; however, a repeat x-ray 1 year ago showed mild osteoarthritis in the lumbar region with degenerative disc disease at L5-S1. She reports that she has been doing physical therapy exercises for her back, which help with the pain (Tables 4 and 5).</p>

<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> Based on the radiographic findings, which of the following is the most accurate statement about Laura's diagnosis? </p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#9633;	There is enough evidence to make a definitive diagnosis of AS </p>

<p>&#9633;	There is not enough evidence to make a definitive diagnosis of AS, and the only diagnosis one can make now is axSpA</p>

<p>&#9633;	There is not enough evidence to make any diagnosis, and an MRI is needed in order to make a definitive diagnosis of axSpA</p>

<p>&#9633;	There is not enough evidence to make any diagnosis and an MRI is needed in order to make a definitive diagnosis of AS</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>The x-ray shows grade II sacroiliitis on the left side and grade III on the right, which is enough to make the diagnosis of radiographic axSpA, or AS. MRI is not required and will add nothing to the diagnosis or treatment plan.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion</strong></p>

<p>The diagnosis of AS is generally made by combining clinical criteria of inflammatory back pain with enthesitis and/or inflammatory peripheral arthritis with radiologic findings on sacroiliac joint x-rays (Table 6).<sup>[41-43]</sup> The presence of definitive sacroiliitis on plain radiography combined with Laura's symptoms is sufficient to make the diagnosis of AS.<sup>[44]</sup> Sacroiliitis grading can be achieved using plain radiographs according to the modified New York criteria (Table 7).<sup>[45]</sup> </p>

<p><strong>Table 6. Modified New York Criteria for AS<sup>[44]</sup></strong></p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis: Clinical Criteria</strong></p>

<p>Low back pain and stiffness for more than 3 months which improves with exercise, but is not relieved by rest </p>

<p>Limitation of lumbar spine motion in both sagittal and frontal planes</p>

<p>Limitation of chest expansion relative to normal values corrected for age and sex</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis: Radiologic Criteria</strong></p>

<p>Sacroiliitis grade &#8805;2 bilaterally or sacroiliitis grade 3-4 unilaterally</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;caption&gt;&gt;Requirements: 1 of 2 radiologic criterion AND any clinical criteria </strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;end table 6&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Table 7. Sacroiliitis Grading According to the New York Criteria<sup>[45]</sup></strong></p>

<p><strong>Grade </strong></p>

<p><strong>Radiographic Findings</strong></p>

<p>0</p>

<p>Normal </p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Some blurring of the joint margins -- suspicious</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Minimal abnormalities: some sclerosis with erosions, normal joint space</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>Unequivocal abnormality: moderate or advanced sacroiliitis with 1 or more signs of erosions, sclerosis, widening, joint space narrowing, or partial ankylosis</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>Total ankylosis</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;end table 7&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p>A contributor to the problem of delayed diagnosis of AS is difficulty in recognizing disease that is not specifically associated with radiographic findings.<sup>[46]</sup> That is illustrated in this case. A synovial cell count of 14,000 suggests inflammatory arthritis, which should prompt a referral to a rheumatologist rather than to an orthopedic surgeon.<sup>[47]</sup></p>

<p>Gender can be another factor in a long diagnostic delay of AS and is an important consideration in treatment. Data indicate that men with axSpA have a worse radiologic prognosis, whereas women have a higher disease burden, partly as a result of a longer delay in diagnosis, higher disease activity, and less responsiveness to treatment with TNF inhibitors.<sup>[48]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 2 Continues</strong></p>

<p>Prior to the time of her referral, Laura continued in physical therapy and with NSAID treatment. Today she rates her back pain as 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 and complains of morning stiffness lasting about 1 hour. Her current BASDAI score is 6.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion </strong></p>

<p>TNF inhibition has been the therapy of choice for patients with established AS. There are 5 different TNF inhibitors currently approved for AS: adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab (Table 8). These agents have all demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of AS, but do differ in molecular structure and administration route.<sup>[29-32,49]</sup> </p>

<p>For adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, ACR/SAS/SPARTAN recommends a TNF inhibitor based on an analysis of 13 RCTs, which showed large and consistent improvements in clinical outcomes.<sup>[1]</sup> However, the panel notes that the trials were short, with most limited to 24 weeks. The panel also emphasizes that the decision to begin treatment with a TNF inhibitor should be made only after educating the patient on the potential risks and benefits. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;end table 8&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p>For patients with no significant comorbidities, there is probably no difference between adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, golimumab, and infliximab in terms of efficacy, though no head-to-head studies are available. However, if the patient has recurrent episodes of iritis, then treatment with infliximab or adalimumab should be preferred over etanercept.<sup>[1]</sup> In patients with IBD, treatment with TNF inhibitor monoclonal antibodies over treatment with etanercept is recommended.<sup>[1]</sup> </p>

<p>Infectious complications have been shown with use of TNF inhibitors; therefore, before treatment, screening for tuberculosis and certain viral infections (such as hepatitis B virus) is recommended. In addition, injection site reactions are reported with use of these agents. </p>

<p>Limited evidence exists on the efficacy of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in SpA.<sup>[55-57]</sup> In controlled studies, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and leflunomide have demonstrated modest efficacy on the peripheral manifestations of AS; however, based on a very low to moderate level of evidence of small or no clinical effects, ACR/SAA/SPARTAN conditionally recommends against the use of these agents in most patients whose AS remained active despite NSAID use.<sup>[1]</sup> Instead, treatment with a TNF inhibitor is recommended. Sulfasalazine may be considered in patients who have contraindications to TNF inhibitors or in patients with peripheral arthritis.<sup>[5]</sup></p>

<p><strong>Question 8:</strong> What is an appropriate response to Laura's question about discontinuing naproxen?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#9633;	There are ample data establishing the benefits of taking a combination of TNF inhibitor and NSAID</p>

<p>&#9633;	Given the clinical evidence in Laura's case, she would likely derive some benefit from remaining on both medications </p>

<p>&#9633;	There is no way to know how Laura would do on etanercept alone</p>

<p>&#9633;	 A trial of etanercept alone can be considered </p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>Because Laura is doing so well, she can discontinue the naproxen, take etanercept alone, and assess how she feels. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion</strong></p>

<p>Current practice is that if a patient with AS is doing well on measures such as BASDAI, there is no need for combination therapy. The ACR/SAA/SPARTAN conditionally recommends continuing treatment with a TNF inhibitor alone in patients with stable AS on TNF inhibitor and NSAID combination therapy.<sup>[1]</sup> Some data show that a combination of a TNF inhibitor and an NSAID might be better than monotherapy for reducing radiographic progression, but these data are still preliminary. The question is being explored in an ongoing trial.<sup>[58]</sup></p>

<p>A recently reported prospective observational cohort study evaluated NSAID use in relation to disease activity during 52 weeks of follow-up in patients with established AS who were treated with or without TNF inhibitor.<sup>[59]</sup> Patients who used TNF inhibitor therapy were advised that after 3 months of using the TNF inhibitor, they should start taking their NSAID only as needed. However, many patients reduced or stopped NSAID use on their own initiative even earlier. Overall, concomitant NSAID use in the TNF inhibitor group declined rapidly.</p>

<p>It is important that patients who smoke be educated about the consequences of continuing to smoke and be counseled to stop. The available data indicate that smoking has a dose-dependent impact on progressive structural damage in patients with axSpA.<sup>[60]</sup> Patients who smoke have worse scores on measures of function and disease progression, as well as more pain, poorer overall assessment of health, and reduced physical mobility and quality of life. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 2 Continues</strong></p>

<p>After about 3 years of feeling well on etanercept, Laura starts having more pain. At her 3-year follow-up visit, her ASDAS has increased from 1.7 to 3.3, and her BASDAI score has gone from 2.0 to 3.8. </p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p>Laura is a 41-year-old woman with a diagnosis of AS. She begins treatment with etanercept and naproxen. At her first follow-up appointment, her BASDAI score is a 4, down 2 from her previous appointment. Her Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) has decreased from 2.3 to 1.7. Because Laura is doing so well, the naproxen is discontinued. After about 3 years of feeling well on etanercept, Laura starts having more pain. At her 3-year follow-up visit, her ASDAS has increased from 1.7 to 3.3, and her BASDAI score has gone from 2 to 3.8. </p>

<p><strong>Question 9:</strong> Based on these findings, which of the following is the next best step for treatment? </p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#9633;	Increase the dose of etanercept</p>

<p>&#9633;	Add an NSAID back to the treatment plan</p>

<p>&#9633;	Switch to either a different TNF inhibitor or to secukinumab </p>

<p>&#9633;	Add a topical glucocorticoid</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>In cases in which a TNF inhibitor becomes ineffective, patients should be switched to a second TNF inhibitor or to secukinumab.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion</strong></p>

<p>In patients who initially respond to TNF inhibitor treatment and then experience diminished efficacy over time, switching to another TNF inhibitor is a reasonable option.<sup>[28]</sup> In case of primary nonresponse, it is important to consider whether this might be the result of an incorrect diagnosis.<sup>[5]</sup></p>

<p>The only other biologic currently approved for the treatment of AS is secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-17A.<sup>[61]</sup> The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) and EULAR were the first to publish guidelines for management of axSpA after the FDA approval of secukinumab. Their joint recommendation is that, if TNF inhibitor therapy fails, a switch to either another TNF inhibitor or to anti-IL-17 therapy should be considered.<sup>[5]</sup> This recommendation is supported by data suggesting that a second TNF inhibitor can be efficacious. However, the level of efficacy may be lower than with the first TNF inhibitor.<sup>[62]</sup></p>

<p>Two randomized, controlled, phase 3 trials, MEASURE 1 and MEASURE 2, have examined the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in adults with active AS.<sup>[12]</sup> The main difference in their design was that loading doses were intravenous in MEASURE 1 and SC in MEASURE 2 (maintenance doses were SC in both trials). According to a combined analysis of the 2 trials, secukinumab was associated with significant reductions in the signs and symptoms of AS at week 16. In both trials, placebo-treated patients switched to secukinumab after week 16 for a noncontrolled extension phase. Additional results from MEASURE 1 have been reported for patients who were originally randomized to 150 mg secukinumab (n=97) or 75 mg (n=103) and completed 2 years of follow-up. ASAS20 response rates at that time point were 73.7% and 68.0%, respectively.<sup>[63]</sup> </p>

<p>The MEASURE 2 trial is designed to last for 5 years, and 3 years of data have been published so far.<sup>[64]</sup> The retention rate was &gt;80%, and secukinumab 150 mg was associated with sustained improvement on all endpoints, including disease activity, BASDAI score, ASDAS, and physical function. </p>

<p>The new therapy should be chosen based on the individual patient's situation. If the patient had inadequate response to the first TNF inhibitor (primary nonresponse) or has to be switched due to an adverse event, it may be better to switch to anti-IL-17 therapy.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 2 Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Laura is switched to secukinumab and is scheduled for follow-up in 3 months. Her BASDAI is down to 2 and her ASDAS is down to 1.3. She is reminded about the potential side effects of treatment and told to call the office if she has concerns. </p>
