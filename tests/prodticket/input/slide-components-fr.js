        <p>&#8226;	Most patients with chronic migraine (CM) and episodic migraine (EM) indicated overall health, stress levels, and enjoyment of free time would be better or a lot better without migraine</p>

        <p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; CM: Features and Challenges</strong><sup><strong>[6,36,37]</strong></sup></p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	CM and EM are clinically, functionally, and anatomically differentiated</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Evidence suggests they may be separate conditions</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Patients with CM usually have more comorbid conditions and more frequent medication overuse</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Complicates clinical management of CM</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Estimated rate of reversion from CM to EM is relatively low</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Studies report remission rates of about 15% to 26%</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Several mAbs targeting CGRP are in development</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>The first was recently approved for migraine prevention</p>

        <p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Fremanezumab for Prevention of CM: HALO-CM</strong><sup><strong>[22]</strong></sup></p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Study looked at reversion of patients with CM to EM with fremanezumab treatment</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Fremanezumab is a CGRP mAb that can be given as a monthly or quarterly injection for prevention of migraine</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>In clinical trials, shown to significantly reduce frequency of migraine and headache without serious treatment-related adverse events</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Phase 3 HALO-CM study</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Patients aged 18 to 70 years with history of migraine for at least 12 months and who met International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-3 criteria for CM</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Randomly assigned to fremanezumab given monthly or quarterly or placebo</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Patients kept a daily diary and completed other questionnaires at regular intervals</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Primary endpoint was mean change in the monthly average number of headache days of at least moderate severity at 12 weeks vs baseline</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability measures</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Study met all of its endpoints</p>

        <p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Reversion From CM to EM With Fremanezumab in HALO-CM</strong><sup><strong>[38]</strong></sup></p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Post hoc analysis of HALO-CM data looked at proportion of patients who reverted from CM to EM</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Met primary outcome</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Fremanezumab demonstrated efficacy as a preventive treatment for CM</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Decrease in mean MHD over the treatment period</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Demonstrated potential benefit for reversion from CM to EM</p>

        <p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Eptinezumab for Prevention of CM: PROMISE-2</strong><sup><strong>[21]</strong></sup></p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	PROMISE-2 study of the CGRP-targeting mAb eptinezumab as a preventive therapy for CM</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Randomly assigned to a single quarterly infusion of 100 mg or 300 mg dose of eptinezumab or placebo</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Enrolled more than 1000 patients who had approximately 16 monthly migraine days at baseline</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Subjects in both eptinezumab groups had a greater reduction in monthly migraine days vs placebo</p>
        
        <p>&#8226;	Study also met secondary endpoints</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>More than half of subjects achieved &gt;50% reduction in MMD from weeks 1 to 12 and at monthly intervals</p>
        
        <p><tt>o	</tt>Significantly higher proportion of patients on eptinezumab achieved 100% reduction in monthly migraine days vs placebo</p>
