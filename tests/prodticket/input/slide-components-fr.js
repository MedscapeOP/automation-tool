        <tt>o   </tt>After 6 months, only 25% remain on treatment

        <tt>o   </tt>After a year, only 15% remain on treatment

        &#8226; If ask people why they discontinue, they give 2 major reasons independent of what class of medication they are on

        <tt>o   </tt>The medicine does not work well enough

        <tt>o   </tt>The medicine causes too many side effects

        <p>

        <strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Weighing Treatment Efficacy and Tolerability</strong></p>

        &#8226; When thinking about whether to continue a patient on preventive treatment, look at 2 &#215; 2 table of efficacy vs side effects

        <tt>o   </tt>In cell A, the treatment is working, does not produce side effects

        <tt>o   </tt>Very likely the treatment that should be continued

        &#8226; In cell D, the treatment is not effective and produces side effects

        <tt>o   </tt>Very little chance patients will continue treatment and clinicians also unlikely to continue

        &#8226; Cell C is the most common situation with oral generic preventive medications for migraine

        <tt>o   </tt>Medication is at least somewhat effective but also producing side effects

        <tt>o   </tt>Patients and clinicians have a difficult choice to make

        &#8226; Emerging monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for migraine are particularly attractive

        <tt>o   </tt>They provide efficacy with little in the way of penalty in terms of adverse events

        <tt>o   </tt>Much greater chance of keeping people in cell A

        <strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Identifying Natural Subgroups of Migraine</strong><sup><strong>[10]</strong></sup></p>

        &#8226; Study identifying natural subgroups of migraine to address questions

        <tt>o   </tt>Why is migraine so common?

        <tt>o   </tt>Why do the clinical features of migraine vary so much from person to person?

        <tt>o   </tt>Why is treatment response so variable?

        &#9642; Why does one person respond to a tricyclic antidepressant, another to a beta-blocker, and another to an antiepilepsy drug?

        <tt>o   </tt>Why has it been so difficult to identify genes for migraine?

        &#9642; Identified genes for rare forms of migraine like familial hemiplegic migraine

        <tt>o   </tt>Most of genetic determinants of more common forms of migraine remain to be identified

        &#8226; Solution is to do a better job of characterizing natural subgroups of people with migraine

        <tt>o   </tt>One approach is to use comorbidity profiles

        &#9642; Use conditions that travel along with migraine to identify natural subgroups of migraine

        <tt>o   </tt>In clinical trials, shown to significantly reduce frequency of migraine and headache without serious treatment-related adverse events
        
        &#8226; Phase 3 HALO-CM study
        
        <tt>o   </tt>Patients aged 18 to 70 years with history of migraine for at least 12 months and who met International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-3 criteria for CM
        
        <tt>o   </tt>Randomly assigned to fremanezumab given monthly or quarterly or placebo
        
        <tt>o   </tt>Patients kept a daily diary and completed other questionnaires at regular intervals
        
        &#8226; Primary endpoint was mean change in the monthly average number of headache days of at least moderate severity at 12 weeks vs baseline
        
        <tt>o   </tt>Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability measures
        
        &#8226; Study met all of its endpoints

        <strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Reversion From CM to EM With Fremanezumab in HALO-CM</strong><sup><strong>[38]</strong></sup></p>
        
        &#8226; Post hoc analysis of HALO-CM data looked at proportion of patients who reverted from CM to EM
        
        <tt>o   </tt>Met primary outcome
        
        &#8226; Fremanezumab demonstrated efficacy as a preventive treatment for CM
        
        <tt>o   </tt>Decrease in mean MHD over the treatment period
        
        &#8226; Demonstrated potential benefit for reversion from CM to EM

        &#8226; PROMISE-2 study of the CGRP-targeting mAb eptinezumab as a preventive therapy for CM
        
        <tt>o   </tt>Randomly assigned to a single quarterly infusion of 100 mg or 300 mg dose of eptinezumab or placebo
        
        <tt>o   </tt>Enrolled more than 1000 patients who had approximately 16 monthly migraine days at baseline
        
        &#8226; Subjects in both eptinezumab groups had a greater reduction in monthly migraine days vs placebo
        
        &#8226; Study also met secondary endpoints
        
        <tt>o   </tt>More than half of subjects achieved &gt;50% reduction in MMD from weeks 1 to 12 and at monthly intervals
        
        <tt>o   </tt>Significantly higher proportion of patients on eptinezumab achieved 100% reduction in monthly migraine days vs placebo
