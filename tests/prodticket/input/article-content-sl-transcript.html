<p><strong>James A. Underberg, MD</strong>: 	Hello, and welcome to this program entitled Lipids, the Heart and the Kidney: A New Triad in the Making. My name is Dr James Underberg. I'm a clinical assistant professor of medicine at the NYU School of Medicine and director of the Bellevue Hospital Lipid Clinic in New York City.</p>

<p>	I'm here today with 2 friends and colleagues. The first, Dr Bob Giugliano. Dr Giugliano is the associate professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School, the Brigham and Women's Hospital in the division of cardiovascular medicine in Boston, Massachusetts. Welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Robert P. Giugliano, MD</strong>: 	Thank you, Jamie. Glad to be here.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg</strong>:	Good to have you with us. And also, to my right, Dr Matthew Weir. Dr Weir is a professor of medicine and the director of the Division of Nephrology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. Great to have you here, too.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew R. Weir, MD:</strong> 	It's a great pleasure.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	All right, so we're going to jump right in. We've got a great topic today, a lot of interesting things to talk about, and are really going to be focusing on this intersection between lipids, cardiovascular (CV) disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p>

<p>	To kind of lay the groundwork for this discussion, what I wanted to do is just talk briefly about the burden of CV disease (CVD) in patients with CKD. And what's interesting is that there are traditional risk factors that both CKD and CVD share.</p>

<p>	But, independent of this, it seems that patients with CKD are at increased risk for CVD, but indeed CVD may play a role in the development of CKD. Independent of all of this, there may be some nontraditional risk factors that we'll talk about that may be also playing a role in the intersection between these 2 important disease states.</p>

<p>	When comes to the CKD burden in this country, I think it's important to understand that this affects about 10% of adults in the United States. What's really important is that it's age related. As patients age, the incidence and the prevalence of CKD increases, and it seems to become more severe as they age, also.</p>

<p>	Indeed, the other side of the coin is this intersection between CKD and CVD risk. As estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) worsens, or more patients have reduced eGFR, the rate of CVD also increases. And so, again, these two are interrelated both on a pathophysiologic perspective but also, obviously, we see the epidemiologic intersection of them. And so that's why we're really going to reach out about this today.</p>

<p>	Finally, often there's been some differentiation. I know, Matt, you're going to talk about this between patients with moderate, severe, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The important thing to drive home here today is that those patients with ESRD are at the highest risk for CVD. As you appropriately point out to us, particularly in these younger patients, it's a big concern. I want to hear your thoughts on this -- you're really our expert in the kidney disease state, and tell us what you think and where we're going with this.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	If one considers the available data, it's quite remarkable that people in their 30s and 40s can have as much as a 100-fold greater risk for CV events if they're on dialysis, compared to the general population. Interestingly, if they have a kidney transplant, it cuts it basically in half. As I like to explain to my patients, the kidney's job is really to purify blood, among other things, and the dirtier your blood, the greater the likelihood of associated vascular disease -- which is why, obviously, people with kidney disease do have more blood vessel disease. And it puts greater, obviously, pressure on us, as clinicians, to try to prevent CVD from progressing in these individuals.</p>

<p>	Now, what I'd like to discuss next is really the other issue that we face in clinical medicine -- and that is, many of our people with kidney disease have diabetes. In fact, probably half, if not more. And it is the combination of both diabetes and CKD that is such a serious problem relative to their risk for CV events.</p>

<p>	Interestingly, Medicare statistics suggest that if you live in this country and you're either 65 years of age or older or have a Medicaid-defining illness, you're 5 times as likely to die from a CV event as you are to reach dialysis. So this, I think, is a very sobering statistic and obviously raises much interest on our part in terms of better control of blood pressure (BP), better control of glucose, and, of course, using lipid-lowering therapy in these patients.</p>

<p>	The cause of so much more CVD, as you alluded to, is not entirely clear. There are both, obviously, traditional as well as nontraditional factors. There are many issues that go on in people with kidney disease, the impurities in the blood, which can accelerate inflammation, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, and whatnot, which can lead to blood vessel damage, we're not really entirely sure. But I think really the message is that we should be employing lipid-lowering therapy routinely in people with CKD...</p>

<p>	...And the SHARP study clearly demonstrated that. It was really a remarkable and impressive study involving more than 9000 people, one-third of whom were actually on dialysis. And they were randomized by chance to either receive placebo or lipid-lowering therapy. And what was demonstrated in this study was a clear overall benefit in terms of CV risk reduction, both for the people not on dialysis and a sensitivity analysis also indicated a benefit for those actually on dialysis.</p>

<p>	Finally, I think the guidelines have caught up. We're now treating based on risk, not based on thresholds. This is particularly important in people with diabetes and CKD or even CKD alone -- is the key message that's new and important to take home.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	You know, it's interesting, in the recent iteration of the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) multidisciplinary guidelines, in the primary prevention cohort, they now list CKD as a risk-modifying factor or a risk enhancer. Similar to things like apo-B lipoprotein, which is also often elevated in patients with CKD and hypertension, as just an example.</p>

<p>	We do need to start thinking about this even in our patients without heart disease, because of how significant a risk factor it is. But on the atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) side, the guidelines also call out CKD -- that's one of the risk factors that moves people from high risk to very high risk, which plays a role in determining how aggressive we are with LDL-lowering therapy. So we finally recognize the fact that you and your colleagues have been talking about for a long time. Bob, any comments on this?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	Well, I couldn't agree more. I think that the data are quite clear that patients who have CKD and is in a graded relationship, too -- the more severe the disease, the higher the risk -- and part of it is that CKD often doesn't travel in isolation, right? It's accompanied by hypertension. As you mentioned, Matt, diabetes, frequently dyslipidemias, is a very complex milieu, and so I think the guidelines have it right in indicating that CKD modifies the risks, both in primary and secondary prevention. Our patients who I care for in CV medicine with CKD are very high risk, very high event rates, and deserve to be treated aggressively.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	All right, great. So why don't we move on. You're going to tell us a little bit of a story about the newer data that you have in FOURIER. But, before we get to that, I just want to go back and talk briefly about some of the associated side effects and the difficulty of using statins in patients with CKD.</p>

<p>	All of us have managed and taken care of patients with risk for CVD or ASCVD and CKD -- and it does pose a little different scenario in taking care of patients. There are some statins that are metabolized differently than others, some that don't get excreted by the kidney at all. And then, obviously, the concern is, are there any other drug-drug interactions with other medications that may impact the way we potentially use that and some other lipid-lowering agents?</p>

<p>	Finally, I think one of the other concerns is that often in people who don't understand how we use these medications, communicating information to our colleagues is important because you may put someone on a medication and it may get stopped by someone else. Have you ever experienced anything like that before?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	Well, all the time. I think the biggest issue, too, is I do get pushback from patients sometimes who read a lot, for example, greater risk for glucose intolerance or diabetes with statins, among other things. I've even had patients raise some concerns about worsening cognitive function with aggressive lipid lowering in contrast to what they, actually the data, show.</p>

<p>	Of course, the other issue is the myopathic circumstances. These strange symptoms, which are often protean in some patients, where they have a strange joint that hurts or something doesn't feel right or they feel weak, where they complain. And you really almost are obligated to do a statin holiday just to see whether or not that could be the problem underneath.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	Well, if you look at patients who complain of statin-associated muscle symptoms, or SAMS, risk factors are multiorgan disease, diabetes, CKD, and polypharmacy. And, as you mentioned, that's who we're caring for here, right?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	That's right, that's right. And there's ongoing work that shows that this is true. Even in contemporary times with newer therapies. We analyzed data from IMPROVE-IT with ezetimibe. And patients at highest risk for these myopathies or even rhabdomyolysis is exactly the group you said, typically diabetics with some renal insufficiency on polypharmacy, sometimes on interfering drugs. More often with the statin, ezetimibe is really not the issue. It's the statin that one needs to consider when combining with certain drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 and patients with renal dysfunction. That can get you in trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	All right, so now we're going to move on. We've talked a bit about statins and the benefit, obviously, from SHARP and some of the issues or concerns in these patients. But now we've got PCSK9 inhibitors available to us. So why don't you tell us a little bit how that fits into the story?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	Yes, and it's great timing, because we finally have some data with the PCSK9 inhibitor, you have evolocumab monoclonal antibody in patients with CKD. And this comes to us from a subgroup analysis from the FOURIER trial, which enrolled over 27,000 patients with stable ASCVD, all of whom were on background statin. 70% or so were on high-intensity statin and then were randomized to evolocumab or a placebo.</p>

<p>	And in this trial, the primary endpoint was a composite of CV events. So broad composite of 5 events, but really, to me as a practicing cardiologist, I also look very carefully at the key secondary endpoint of CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke.   David Charytan did a very nice analysis, which is now accepted for publication, presented at the American Society of Nephrology meetings a few months ago. But we'll take it through some of that data.</p>

<p>	What David did in that analysis was basically analyze patients according to their renal function and look at their outcomes with evolocumab vs placebo. And, in this trial, we had a fair number of patients with advanced CKD, 3 or higher, and that was the cut point. We looked at patients with mild CKD and then preserved renal function. Of course, as you would expect, these patients look different, right? The baseline characters are wildly different. So it's hard to make comparisons across the kidney groups, the renal function groups, but one can certainly compare evolocumab vs placebo in each of these 3 groups of patients and see how the drug does.</p>

<p>	At first observation, the patients with more advanced CKD have more risk factors and much higher event rates. And, depending on which events you're looking at, the magnification may be 50% to 100%, but patients are at much higher risk for CV events as the renal function declines.</p>

<p>	Then, if you look at the outcomes stratified by CKD, what we saw was that evolocumab, first of all, reduced LDL to the same degree regardless of the renal function. So there's no question in my mind that the drug is efficacious in LDL lowering in patients with preserved renal function, mild or moderate to severe. Now the trial excluded patients on dialysis, just hasn't been studied. And I'd like to hear from Matt a little later what your thoughts are on that. But we don't have data on the end-stage dialysis patients. But LDL was lowered the same, the same degree, roughly a 60% reduction.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	And, again, that's on top of real-world use of intensive statin therapy in these patients, right?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	Correct, right. Everybody had to be on a statin in this trial, just under 70% were on high intensity and the remainder were on moderate intensity. There were a few patients on ezetimibe, fewer than 5%, I wish there had been more, but, I think, had we replicated this trial today we would see more ezetimibe use, no doubt.</p>

<p>	Event rates, as I mentioned, were higher in patients with more advanced CKD. However, the treatment effect, the reduction that was seen with evolocumab compared to placebo was preserved across the groups of renal function. Now, there's in any subgroup analysis a little wobble this way or that way, but the important thing is to look at the interaction <em>P</em> value that tells us if there is any meaningful difference in the hazard ratios (HRs) between evolocumab and placebo across the renal function groups, and there was none. So one should feel as confident to use a PCSK9 inhibitor if indicated in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction, CKD class 3/4, as you would in class 2 or preserved renal function.</p>

<p>	Now, recall that in FOURIER there was no effect on CV death and mortality endpoints. We hypothesized that that's because the trial was rather short, at only 2.2 years meeting and follow-up, and the patients had stable ASCVD. There was no signal in the patients with advanced CKD or those with lesser disease or preserved renal function. I think you need a different trial and higher-risk patients with much longer follow-up to answer the mortality question -- certainly no sign of an excess in mortality in patients with advanced CKD.</p>

<p>	On the safety side, there were no differences with regard to a large laundry list of potential safety events. The only thing that's an excess with evolocumab compared to placebo, this is true in the overall trial and also in the CKD patients, are minor injection site reactions. They generally are self-limited and don't require discontinuation of the drug.</p>

<p>	I think a nice message is that, because the event rates are higher as the degree of renal insufficiency worsens, the absolute risk reductions are quite robust in that patient. So you are preventing a significant number of events.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	Are the absolute risk reductions increased in the people with more severe kidney disease?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	It's interesting. It kind of depended on which endpoint you looked at. If you look at the key secondary endpoint, there's a very robust reduction in that group with the most advanced disease.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	Which kind of mirrors the CV data, right?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	Right.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	The more severe the CVD was, you saw a better absolute risk reduction.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	That's right, that's right.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	Yes, I would think it makes total sense, but you know, again, the difficulty in doing further subset analyses of a subset analysis is, obviously, you start to lose a lot of power. I mean, I think the practical reality from this important secondary analysis is that it worked, the LDL went down, people have fewer events, and it was well tolerated. I mean, to me as a clinician, that's the big story.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	That's true. And we didn't find any level of renal function where the drug didn't seem to work.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	But the real question, ultimately, we'll come back to that is, what about dialysis patients?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	For sure, for sure. One more point I want to make about the FOURIER data that's important because people ask, "Well, do these drugs impact the further decline in renal function and do they enhance progression of kidney disease?" And the answer is, "No." We looked at it in a number of ways. Looking at changes in classification of CKD, changes in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), development of diabetes, none of that was different across the groups. So I don't think evolocumab has an impact, either positive or negative.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	Right, didn't worsen. That's important.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	It didn't worsen things, it doesn't make things better.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	But I think also, too, there was actually a recent meta-analysis I looked at where lipid-lowering therapy probably does have a beneficial effect. I mean, again, it was a meta-analysis and they're not perfect, but, again, the problem here is it's such a short study and to really look at the rate of progression of renal disease is going to take more time. I think the big picture is, fascinatingly, they may live longer to develop kidney disease because you're preventing much more commonly seen strokes and heart attacks -- I mean, which is kind of ironic when you think about it, right?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	There's a potential for survivor bias. I think if a drug reduces mortality, then what you're left with is a sicker cohort in that group. Now, in FOURIER we didn't have a reduction in mortality, but one could imagine if you continue the treatment for a decade or more that you'd see that.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	So what about ODYSSEY? Any data there yet?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	ODYSSEY, I would say, had qualitatively similar results, different population, right? Those patients had a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 4 to 52 weeks ago, treated with a different PCSK9 inhibitor, alirocumab, but still a monoclonal antibody given by subcutaneous (SC) injection. There are obviously some differences in the trial, but overall large reduction in LDL, reduction in CV endpoints, and ODYSSEY going a little longer and in a patient population that's a bit sicker, close to the ACS.</p>

<p>	It did show trends toward reductions in mortality. To date we don't have very granular data on patients with renal dysfunction, that's awaited, that analysis. I'm not expecting it to show any different. I view that these drugs have roughly similar effects and manifestations, and I think if a patient qualifies for more intensification of their lipid-lowering therapy with the PCSK9 inhibitor, I'm perfectly comfortable to give it to a patient with preserved renal function, mild, moderate to severe renal dysfunction. That then brings us to the patients where we don't have data, those with end-stage disease who are on hemodialysis.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	I think that this is much tougher. I think, really, the best available data with lipid-lowering therapy is from the SHARP study, which I mentioned earlier. Again, the more than 3000 people on dialysis in the SHARP study actually in total were greater than all of the other previous studies put together, in terms of analyzing lipid-lowering therapy in people with ESRD.</p>

<p>	As I interpret the data, more recent vintage patients on dialysis, preferably within the past couple of years, are less likely to be suffering from the pressure volume overload circumstances that often lead to heart failure and arrhythmia and caused a substantial number of CV deaths in the dialysis population. In a sense, interfering with more atherosclerosis from being a more prevalent cause of CV events.</p>

<p>	I do believe, strongly, that certainly people in late stage 5 and people moving and transitioning from CKD 5 into dialysis deserve therapy. And I would also say people with kidney transplants also deserve therapy, because people with transplants also have much greater proclivity for CV events, which is not entirely explainable by the reduction in GFR. Because, remember, half of it is restored, but there may be other alloimmune inflammatory responses. So they also play a role.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	We have patients who move from stage 4 into stage 5 and then we have the patients with the transplants. What about the patient who comes to you in stage 5 right now, would you manage to treat that patient any differently?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	Historically, I've always been putting these people on statins because I've always been a firm believer that threshold-based therapies are not what we need to be doing. We should be treating people based on risk. And the data, let's be fair, going back even with all the lipid-lowering therapy and people with diabetes, clearly demonstrated that it was risk-based and not threshold-based. Was that my thinking many years ago that, if you have kidney disease, it's like diabetes? In fact, it's even worse in terms of predicting CV events, and you really need to intervene sooner rather than later with lipid-lowering therapy.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	We've certainly got a variety of different people who take care of patients with CKD. Often these patients have a nephrologist and internist, often a cardiologist or an endocrinologist, a diabetologist. And there's certainly a role for everyone to collaborate when caring for these patients. Often what happens is the nephrologist, in many cases, ends up seeing the patient more than anyone else. What kind of message do you have for your colleagues out there who may not be as tuned into what we're talking about as you are?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	The practical reality is these are very complicated patients and people. These types of patients with more advanced CKD, they'll have BP issues, mineral bone disease issues, anemia issues, then they might have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), erectile dysfunction (ED), they might even have a medical problem.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	Every now and then, they do.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	Again, the biggest problem is they die early from CVD. The one statistic that I always like to educate both patients and colleagues about is, again, if you have diabetes and CKD, you're 5 times as likely to die as you are to reach dialysis. The focus should be on CV risk reduction -- and I mean global CV risk.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	This very much mimics what's going on in the diabetes space, right? I know that you and your colleagues are moving into an area now where, as cardiologists, you're often asked to be cardio-diabetologists.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	Right.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	What's going on in the cardiology space now with regards to CKD, and how are you and your colleagues looking at these people? Are you managing to the aggressive degree that Matt is with his patients?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	I think it's still a large unmet need. A lot of cardiologists, CV medicine specialists, aren't as focused on kidney disease as a risk factor. There's obviously opportunity there to recognize that these patients are high risk. I mean, if you went to a cardiologist and you were told the LBF is 20%, everybody would recognize that patient has a bad ventricle. But they may overlook that the GFR is in the 20s, and not realize that portents a very high-risk prognosis for that patient.</p>

<p>	I think the other thing we ought to do better, and our systems here can help us, is with the drug-drug interactions and appropriate renal dosing of CV medications in patients with CKD. I see that as a major area that we could improve upon.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	Right. And I think a lot of times people, if they don't know whether or not they need to adjust the drug, may opt to not use it at all. I mean, we certainly see that in other more complex disease state systems like lipid disorders in patients with HIV or in pregnancy or women of childbearing age, right? Often the de facto is to not treat because people don't know the safety data.</p>

<p>	What you've done in FOURIER, I think, is illuminating for people to know: here's an option that's safe and effective. And what you've done with SHARP is important because, again, it's another option that's safe and effective and, in these high-risk patients, we really need to act sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	The difficulty still is the inertia of adding one more drug, the potential interactions, etc. I think, hopefully, the newer data that you've presented from the FOURIER study and, obviously, hopefully, other studies will be done soon, will provide some more insight in this regard. Because certainly the likelihood of a drug-drug interaction is remote. It's certainly not likely to induce glucose intolerance, which some have been concerned about with statins.</p>

<p>	Obviously, some of the statins, in particular simvastatin is a classic one, have a number of potential drug-drug interactions, which may be problematic for a number of patients. Certainly simvastatin in organ transplant recipients with the calcineurin inhibitors has been a substantial problem, and still is flagged on my electronic medical records, which I have to overcome. Every time I treat a patient with an organ transplant, though, with a statin, so I mean there may be some important opportunities here to look ahead.</p>

<p>	I'm still amazed, though, that there is this much further reduction in LDL in optimally treated patients. See, that to me is, I still think, one of the more impressive observations. It could be even more important, particularly in malnourished and inflamed patients with CKD who may have an LDL in the 70s or 80s. You may say that's fine, but there's so much inflammation in their circulation that you don't see the forest through the trees. And so I think it's important that we do more studies in these types of patients to evaluate the unique opportunity for better vascular protection in them.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	So, Bob, any final thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	Well, I think for the CV audience, be aware of CKD major risk factors. These patients ought to be treated aggressively with respect to risk-factor modification and lipid lowering. And I'd still start with statins and then ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors are a good option.</p>

<p>	In fact, in our latest trial that we announced, the VISALIA CV trial, we added a low GFR as a high-risk feature for entry criteria to get in the trial. We want to study these patients, we recognize they're higher risk. I think they have a greater chance of benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	How low a GFR are you going to have in that study?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	So down to 20 for eligibility.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	Oh, great.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Giugliano:</strong>	Yeah. And below... Well, there's various entry criteria, but below 45 is a high-risk criteria and below 60 can get you in as a major diagnosis with diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	Yeah, it's amazing to me, as a nephrologist, that patients with GFR below 30 have been systematically excluded from every single CV medicine study. I don't care what therapy you want to look at, angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACEs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). I mean, they've always been excluded, unfortunately. I mean, really, only the SHARP study with lipid-lowering therapy really ever included these patients. So I think more data like these to come will be very helpful for us in clinical practice.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	So any other final thoughts from you?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Weir:</strong>	No, again, just view CKD as a CVD risk factor. That's the big story. They need global CV risk-reduction efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Underberg:</strong>	Right. And, in fact, your group has been on the forefront in addressing this. The kidney guidelines have been very aggressive about statins and lipid lowering before lipidologists and cardiologists were. And so my final thoughts to my colleagues on the internal medicine side and lipidology side are that we're often in the center of this. And it's important to recognize CKD just like we recognize diabetes, just like we recognize peripheral vascular disease. These are these lurking risk factors that have a tremendous ability to magnify CV risk and, potentially, then, the benefit of lipid-lowering interventions -- that's really the message we want to deliver to our colleagues.</p>

<p>	So with that final thought, I'd like to thank you, Bob, and you, Matt, for being here with us today. This has been a great conversation. I think a lot of great, great, important points came out of the discussion. And I'd like to thank you for participating in this activity. Please proceed to answer the post-activity assessment questions and receive credit. Please also take a moment to complete the program evaluation.</p>
