<p>Treatment with direct-acting antivirals appears to reduce the risk for death and liver cancer among patients with chronic HCV infection, including patients with cirrhosis, new research showed.</p>

<p>In a prospective cohort study of more than 10,000 adult patients with HCV, risk for all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, non&#8211;liver-related mortality, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was significantly reduced among patients who received DAAT compared with patients who did not, Fabrice Carrat, PhD, Sorbonne University, French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, Paris, and colleagues reported.</p>

<p>The study was published online February 11 in <em>The Lancet</em>.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

<p>Yet although decompensated cirrhosis was not significantly influenced by DAAT, patients with cirrhosis who achieved sustained virologic response with DAAT experienced similarly decreased mortality and cancer risk, the authors wrote.</p>

<p>Reports in the literature of a possible increase in the occurrence and recurrence of HCC related to DAAT in chronic HCV have spurred some controversy, the authors wrote. Although previous observational studies have linked DAAT with reduced risk for mortality and liver cancer in patients with chronic HCV, the heterogeneity of the study populations, variations in inclusion and exclusion criteria, follow-up time, and other considerations have led researchers to seek more definitive answers, they noted.</p>

<p>The current investigation -- which the authors said is the first prospective longitudinal study to address clinical outcomes in DAA-treated HCV -- was designed to do just that. The French ANRS CO22 Hepather study compared outcomes among patients treated with DAAs with an untreated control group, independent of their sustained viral response status.</p>

<p>The study enrolled 14,389 patients with antibodies against HCV between August 6, 2012 and December 31, 2015, including 11,870 with chronic HCV infection at entry. After excluding patients with active hepatitis B virus coinfection at entry; a history of HCC; decompensated cirrhosis; a history of liver transplantation; or a history of receiving peginterferon and ribavirin with or without a first-generation protease inhibitor, along with patients for whom follow-up information was not available, 9895 patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, 7344 patients were treated with DAAs and 2551 were not.</p>

<p>Compared with the untreated control group, patients in the DAAT group were older, had more comorbidities, and had more severe liver disease. In adjusted multivariable analyses of outcomes over a median 33.4 months, exposure to DAAs significantly reduced all-cause mortality by 52% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.48 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.7]; <em>P</em> =.0001), liver-related mortality by 61% (HR=0.39 [95% CI: 0.21, 0.71]; <em>P</em> =.002), non&#8211;liver-related mortality by 40% (HR=0.6 [95% CI: 0.36, 1]; <em>P</em> =.048), and HCC by 34% (HR=0.66 [95% CI: 0.46, 0.93]; <em>P</em> =.018). Nonetheless, DAAT was not associated with a reduction in risk for decompensated cirrhosis (HR=1.14 [95% CI: 0.57, 2.27]; <em>P</em> =.72). The authors stratified patients according to whether they achieved a sustained virologic response and found that patients who did significantly reduce their risk for all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, non&#8211;liver-related mortality, and HCC compared with untreated patients. There was also a trend toward reduced risk for decompensated cirrhosis, but it did not reach statistical significance.</p>

<p>Still, patients treated with DAAs who did not achieve a sustained virologic response had an increased risk for HCC compared with their untreated peers (HR=2.23 [95% CI: 1.37, 3.64]; <em>P</em> =.0012).</p>

<p>A similar pattern was seen in a subgroup analysis of patients with cirrhosis. Patients who achieved sustained virologic response showed a reduced risk for all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, non&#8211;liver-related mortality, and HCC; however, the patients with cirrhosis who failed to achieve sustained virologic response were at increased risk for HCC.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Strongest Evidence Yet to Support Treatment With DAAs </strong></h3>
<p>The reduced risk for non&#8211;liver-related mortality in patients treated with DAA compared with untreated control participants was a "striking finding," the authors wrote. "Although a decrease in long-term, non&#8211;liver-related mortality has been reported in patients with sustained [virologic] response compared with those without a sustained biological response after interferon-based therapy, reverse causality could be another possibility if patients with the most severe liver disease and the highest risk for death from any cause had a lower probability of starting direct-acting antiviral treatment," they noted.</p>

<p>In this case, however, patients with decompensated cirrhosis or a history of HCC were excluded at baseline. Further, the analyses were adjusted for markers of liver insufficiency and comorbidities, and the results were similar even after exclusion of the first 12 months of follow-up. Together, these considerations "seem to exclude reverse causality," the authors concluded.</p>

<p>The observational study design prevented the investigators from reporting a cause-and-effect inverse relationship between DAAT and mortality and liver cancer risks, "[h]owever we can postulate about plausible mechanisms," they wrote. "Direct-acting antivirals induce a sustained [virologic] response, reducing liver damage and inflammation. This effect causes liver regeneration, decreasing risk for progression to liver-related complications or hepatocellular carcinoma."</p>

<p>Although several considerations potentially limited the study findings, including different methods of data collection for deriving fibrosis and cirrhosis information from patient records and a short follow-up duration, none of the reported limitations "would be expected to materially affect the overall findings and most likely biased the findings away from clinical benefit with direct-acting antivirals," according to the authors of an accompanying commentary.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

<p>Jacinta A. Holmes, PhD, from the Liver Center, gastrointestinal division, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and colleagues stated that the study "offers substantive evidence" that a DAA-related HCV cure offers additional clinical benefits. The findings "provide the best evidence to date to support guidance documents that recommend direct-acting antiviral treatment for all patients with chronic HCV infection," the editorialists wrote.</p>

<p>They added that the results also support the possibility of eliminating HCV and reducing its complications, consistent with the guidelines established by the World Health Organization.</p>

<td><p>&#8226;	Study data were drawn from a cohort of French patients with a history of infection with hepatitis B or C. This group was identified in 2012.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Patients with chronic HCV infection without current treatment of HCV and no history of HIV infection were eligible for the current analysis.</p>

<p>&#8226;	All patients were followed annually. The main outcomes of the current study were mortality, HCC, and decompensated cirrhosis.</p>

<p>&#8226;	The main study variable was previous receipt of DAAT.</p>

<p>&#8226;	A multivariable analysis was performed to assess whether DAAT was associated with better long-term outcomes.</p>

<p>&#8226;	9895 adults provided data for study analysis. The median age of participants was 56 years, and 53% were men; 13% of participants had evidence of cirrhosis.</p>

<p>&#8226;	7344 participants began DAAT at a median of 4.3 months after study enrollment. These patients were compared with 2551 participants who did not receive DAAT. The median follow-up period for study outcomes was 31.2 months.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Receiving DAAT was associated with older age, male sex, higher body mass index, and a higher rate of heavy alcohol use. HCV infection was of longer duration and more likely to be associated with cirrhosis among participants receiving DAAT.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Therefore, the initial analysis demonstrated that DAAT was associated with a higher risk for all negative outcomes.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Still, after multivariable analysis, DAAT was associated with a lower risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=0.48 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.7]) and liver-related death (HR=0.39 [95% CI: 0.21, 0.71]) and non&#8211;liver-related death (HR=0.6 [95% CI: 0.36, 1]). </p>

<p>&#8226;	DAAT was also associated with a lower risk for HCC (HR=0.66 [95% CI: 0.46, 0.93]). Rates of decompensated cirrhosis were similar in the DAAT and control groups.</p>

<p>&#8226;	The vast majority of patients receiving DAAT had a sustained virologic response, which was associated with significant improvements in the risks for mortality and HCC.</p>

<p>&#8226;	A subgroup analysis limited to patients with cirrhosis demonstrated somewhat stronger salutary effects of DAAT on the risks for mortality and HCC; however, DAAT was not significantly effective for these outcomes among participants without cirrhosis.</p>
