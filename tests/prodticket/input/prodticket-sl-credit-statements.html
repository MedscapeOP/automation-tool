    <p><em>Place CME posttest and </em><em>pre-assessment/post-assessment question pairs</em> &#953;<em> in this section. Click </em>+<em> to add additional question building blocks as needed. Adhere to character limits.</em></p>
    
    <p>Question 1</p>
    
    <p>Question type: Pre/Post Assessment Question Pairs (LLA)</p>
    
    <p>Question Introduction (optional &#953;): </p>
    
    <p>Question: In a recent survey assessing the burden of rosacea, how many patients reported making substantial changes to their daily life as a result of rosacea?</p>
    
    <p>Answer choices &#953;:</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	1 in 5 </p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	1 in 10 </p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	1 in 25 </p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	1 in 50 </p>
    
    <p>Answer explanation: A survey of patients with rosacea revealed that 1 in 5 would make substantial changes to their daily life (ie, avoiding social interactions). The survey asked 710 patients diagnosed with rosacea questions about their experience of living with rosacea. Approximately 50% of patients reported that they would potentially be willing to trade 6 months or more of their life to cure rosacea, and 86% of patients would modify their behavior to manage their symptoms</p>
    
    <p>Question 2</p>
    
    <p>Question reporting priority: Choose an item.</p>
    
    <p>Question must follow question # (optional):</p>
    
    <p>Question type: Pre/Post Assessment Question Pairs (LLA)</p>
    
    <p>Question Introduction (optional &#953;): A 40-year-old woman presents to your clinic with self-diagnosed "acne." Physical examination reveals scattered papules, pustules, and diffuse redness and spider veins on her chin and cheeks. She has no comedones on her face and no lesions on her chest or back.</p>
    
    <p>Question: Based on your examination, how would you categorize her rosacea?</p>
    
    <p>Answer choices &#953;:</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Erythematotelangiectatic and phymatous rosacea</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Papulopustular and phymatous rosacea</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Erythematotelangiectatic and papulopustular rosacea</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Phyamatous rosacea</p>
    
    <p>Answer Explanation: It is important to carefully evaluate the clinical presentation of rosacea as not everyone fits perfectly into 1 subtype. Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea is distinguished by flushing, redness, and visible blood vessels. Dryness, roughness, or scaling also may occur. Diffuse vascular erythema (flushing) is rosacea's most common symptom. Papulopustular rosacea manifests as redness, swelling, and acne-like breakouts that may come and go, usually developing where the skin is most reddened. Phymatous rosacea is characterized by skin thickenings and irregular surface nodularities of the nose, chin, forehead, 1 or both ears, and/or the eyelid.</p>
    
    <p>Question 3</p>
    
    <p>Question reporting priority: Choose an item.</p>
    
    <p>Question must follow question # (optional):</p>
    
    <p>Question type: Pre/Post Assessment Question Pairs (LLA)</p>
    
    <p>Question Introduction (optional &#953;): </p>
    
    <p>Question: Which of the following is the best method for the healthcare team to select an initial treatment plan for a newly-diagnosed patient with papulopustular rosacea?</p>
    
    <p>Answer choices &#953;:</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Instruct the patient to try a gentle cleanser and moisturizer before selecting pharmacotherapy</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Start with an open conversation with the patient and consider therapy according to subtype of rosacea</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Initiate monotherapy before selecting combination therapy</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Informing the patient that papulopustular rosacea could be cured quickly</p>
    
    <p>Answer explanation: It is important for healthcare professionals to engage patients in shared decision-making and start with an open, non-judgemental conversation about available treatment options. Therapy should be based according to the subtype(s) of rosacea present. Combination therapy may be necessary to treat the different subtypes of rosacea present.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Question 4</p>
    
    <p>Question reporting priority: Choose an item.</p>
    
    <p>Question must follow question # (optional):</p>
    
    <p>Question type: Pre/Post Assessment Question Pairs (LLA)</p>
    
    <p>Question Introduction (optional &#953;): </p>
    
    <p>Question: How confident are you right now in your ability to develop a comprehensive treatment plan based on shared decision-making for patients with rosacea?</p>
    
    <p>Answer choices &#953;:</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;1 - Not confident</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;2 - Slightly confident</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;3 - Moderately confident</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;4 - Mostly confident</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;5 - Very confident</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Question 5 (demographic)</p>
    
    Question: How many patients with rosacea do you currently manage per week?&#8226;	0&#8226;	1 to 5&#8226;	6 to 10&#8226;	11 to 15&#8226;	More than 15<p></p>
    


    
    <p>Question type: CME Posttest</p>
    
    <p>Question Introduction (optional &#953;): </p>
    
    <p>Question: How would you assess the effects of rosacea on a patient's quality of life (QoL)?</p>
    
    <p> Answer choices &#953;:</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Rate the impact on QoL based on the patient's tone of voice and facial expression during evaluation</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Estimate the extent of involvement of rosacea</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Ask the patient how rosacea has impacted their life</p>
    
    <p>&#8226;	Consider the number of rosacea subtypes  </p>
    
    <p>Answer explanation: It is paramount for healthcare professionals inquire about the patient's QoL and consider their assessment of themselves. Rosacea can have a negative impact on the QoL and well-being of patients regardless of clinical severity or disease subtype. </p>

<p><strong>Linda F. Stein Gold, MD:</strong>	Hi, I'm Dr Linda Stein Gold, director of clinical research at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. Welcome to our program titled The Real Burden of Rosacea, Patients and Physicians Weigh In.</p>

<p>		Joining me today is Beth, a patient with rosacea. Welcome, Beth. Thanks so much for joining us today.</p>

<p><strong>Beth Adams:</strong>		Glad to be here.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		I know you've been dealing with rosacea for quite a long time. What I'd like you to do is walk us through your journey, and let us know some of the feelings you had dealing with it, your struggles.</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		So I never really had a formal diagnosis of rosacea until maybe 15 years ago. But after I found out about the diagnosis, I thought back. I've probably had it all my life. I have 4 sisters, they all have the rosy form, and I unfortunately had the bumpy form, as I found out after I was diagnosed.</p>

<p>		I think I had some breakouts when I was young that I attributed to teenage acne, but really was probably in reality the same rosacea that I have today. It progressively got worse later in life, which really spearheaded my going to see someone about it. I tried just about everything that they had to offer, and it just wasn't working so well. Some things worked. Usually the only thing that worked for me was antibiotic therapy, but I didn't want to continue antibiotic therapy forever. It was bothersome to my tummy.</p>

<p>		Then there was also the feeling of being self-conscious about the way I looked and the way I presented, because I work in healthcare and I was wondering what people are thinking. I even had people asking me things like, "Are you okay?" and, "What's that on your face?" </p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		You mentioned you had the breakouts as an adolescent, and then had a little bit of a grace period where you weren't breaking out. Then you had it again as an adult. Was it more personally devastating to you as an adult versus an adolescent?</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		That's an age where you shouldn't have to deal with that kind of thing. As I was working and it was impacting me, there were days I didn't even want to go to work, because I had so many lesions on my face. I said, "This doesn't look good."</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>	 	Did you feel like you were being judged?</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		When people are asking you, "Are you all right?" and you're perfectly healthy and fine, it's just that you have this facial breakout and you can't find something to make it go away, you become more self-conscious about it. It was almost to the point of being depressed about it.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		When you woke up in the morning as an adult and you looked in the mirror, did that impact how you faced the day?</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		Yes, and I'm going, "How do I hide this," right? It's like, it'll go away, but I'm going to have to start the antibiotics again. The topicals really didn't work for me. We tried just about everything known to man. I tried a few things myself and tried to follow the routines prescribed to me. I found out it's not a one-size-fits-all, that some things work for some people and don't work for other people.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		Looking at you today, you look pretty clear. I think that probably means that you did find appropriate therapy for you, but it sounds like it was a journey to get to that place.</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		I tell people just keep cracking away at it. Make sure your provider knows, that they're listening to you, and that this is impacting your life. It may just be a few spots today, but then it can turn into 10 or 15 spots tomorrow. It's not okay.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		What do you know now that you've gotten to a point of clear, that you wish you knew maybe 10 or 15 years ago?</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		I wish that I would have just kept pursuing it and kept communicating it. I went for periods of time where I'm like, "I'm just going to have to live with this. It's not working." Then thankfully, a study became available to me, and it worked for me. I just tell people to keep trying, and make sure you're communicating what's happening with you with your doctor so that eventually they'll hear you and do something about it.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		Did you feel that you were not listened to or maybe ignored a little bit? Because people come in and they have other issues, and if you don't come in for that one thing, maybe it's- Did you feel dismissed?</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		In the scheme of things, there are a lot worse things to have; but personally, it impacted me probably as much as having cancer might impact somebody else. It's something that you don't want to deal with. It definitely impacts your happiness.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		And that's really interesting. </p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		I'm blushing now.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		We're trying to educate healthcare prescribers that this is a disease that not only has a physical impact, because I know your face is sensitive and it stings and it's irritated, but it also has an emotional impact. If you could speak to the prescribers, what's the one kernel of truth that you wish they would understand the next time they see a rosacea patient?</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		Don't discount what your patient is saying to you. It's definitely important that you're listening to them and you're hearing what you have to say. They may not even be telling you how much it's impacting their life. They may be staying home instead of going out and enjoying themselves, because they have this horrible breakout.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		As a dermatologist, should I be asking those questions proactively to my patient who might not volunteer it?</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:	</strong>	You need to get a sense for how it's impacting the quality of their life. Just like almost everything that we look at, it impacts the quality of their life.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		To the patients who have rosacea, what message would you give them?</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>	 	I've told all my sisters, I have a plan for you if you develop what I've developed. My sister was telling me the other day that she's starting to get little bumps. I'll probably refer her to you. But yeah, like I said, it's not a one-size-fits-all disease. You have a variety of symptoms and you have a variety of facial breakouts, so just keep communicating. If someone's not listening to you, then find one someone who will listen to you. </p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		That's great advice, and I think it's so important. You've obviously gotten yourself to a place of clear skin. How do you feel now? Like when you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror, does your rosacea impact your day anymore?</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		No, it doesn't. In fact, I'm having people tell me how great my skin looks right now. </p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		I want to thank you, because your insights have been so helpful. This is a condition that is so important for us in the dermatology world to really understand the patient perspective. We see you, we look at you, but we only see a small snapshot. I think your advice on talking to the patient, trying to understand how the whole disease impacts their life is really critical. Your point, shoot for clear. Try to get as clear as possible. Find the prescriber that works with you and the treatment plan that works best for you. Beth, thank you very much. We appreciate all of your thoughts. Have a great day.</p>

<p><strong>Ms Adams:</strong>		Thank you, Dr Stein Gold.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>	<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=MbnuzYH-GGlDP6fsq8Q4y-1fbHrfMKU_NM7zaeXMKNdsOTGB9ao4QoZb6rS7DeLTyTqmBu2Zb1pslvHD1PFKlGN1k4Q&loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&ts=6.72"></a>	Joining me now are Dr Emmy Graber, who is the president of the Dermatology Institute of Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. And Victor Czerkasij, who is a nurse practitioner at the Skin Cancer and Cosmetic Dermatology Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Thank you both so much for joining me today.</p>

<p>		Rosacea is a chronic cutaneous condition that's characterized by flushing and persistent erythema of the central face. The disease may also feature telangiectasias, papules and pustules, phymatous changes, and even ocular involvement. Diagnosing rosacea can be challenging, due the variable clinical manifestations, and the wide variety of skin disorders that can exhibit similar clinical features. We can even see rosacea in skin of color, and the diagnosis can be more challenging because it's more difficult to perceive the erythema. When we look at fair-skinned populations, the prevalence of rosacea ranges from about five to ten percent.</p>

<p>		Emmy, there are numerous factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of rosacea. Can you talk to us about the pathophysiology?</p>

<p><strong>Emmy M. Graber, MD, MBA:</strong>	Sure. We know that the pathophysiology of rosacea is incredibly complex. But central to the pathophysiology of rosacea is innate immune dysfunction, dysfunction of the innate immune system. Also, neurovascular dysregulation, as well as overexpression of inflammatory mediators, and some triggering factors can play a role.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		When we look at the triggers, are they different for each patient, or does there tend to be some central ones?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		It really varies from person to person. Not everyone has the exact same triggers. For some people, it's sunlight that's a big trigger. For some people, it's cold, windy weather. Other people, it might be exercise or food.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong> 		Emmy, we talked about the fact that rosacea can look like many other skin conditions, especially acne. How do you go about making that diagnosis?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		That's a great question. There are several skin conditions that sometimes can be confused for rosacea, but you're right, primarily acne is sometimes confused for rosacea. With acne, if you look closely, you see papules, pustules, but you'll also see comedones with acne. Might be open comedones, closed comedones, likely a combination of both. Whereas with rosacea, there will be no comedones. There's some other skin conditions too that are sometimes confused for rosacea. I think seborrheic dermatitis being one of those. With seborrheic dermatitis, if you're unsure, look very closely at the nasal creases, there might be some scaling, it might be a little bit shiny or greasier in appearance than the rest of the skin. There might be scaling on the cheeks. Sometimes cutaneous lupus is confused for the erythematotelangiectatic type of rosacea. And with lupus you see the sharper line of demarcation oftentimes with the erythema. Sometimes photoaging presents with erythema and telangiectatic. Often that's seen more in the lateral aspects of the face, whereas with rosacea, it's more of a central facial erythema that you see on the central cheeks, the nose, on the chin.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>	 	Victor, any other comments here?</p>

<p><strong>Victor Czerkasij, MSN, NP-C:</strong> 	Emmy's absolutely correct. We do have a number of conditions that can present themselves on the face all at the same time. I remember a man who was very frustrated with his healthcare provider who was spraying liquid nitrogen on actinic keratosis, about 15 to 20 of them every 3 months for a few years. Once they came to see me and wanted to find out why those actinic keratoses (AKs) never went away, right away I noticed that they had seborrheic dermatitis. You can see that classic greasy yellow across the nasolabial lines and in the ears. We were able to treat that rather quickly, it responds so well. Then I could see also rosacea. Once we got the rosacea under control, there was only about 4 or 5 actinic keratosis. We're unpeeling the onion, we have multiple issues all at once in this spectrum of skin. Dermatology is a fascinating place to be, but there's a reason why it's one of the hardest of the specialties is we have so many disorders over such a large area. It's all focused on the face oftentimes, which is present to the public.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		Thank you. Those were really, really great tips.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		When we think about rosacea, it's really kind of a big category. There are different subtypes. How do we differentiate them?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>	 	Yeah, there are 4 different categories of rosacea, 4 subtypes. First, there's erythematotelangiectatic. There's also papulopustular rosacea. Thirdly, there's phymatous rosacea, and there's ocular rosacea. Not everyone fits perfectly into 1 subtype. Some people may have 2 or even 3 subtypes.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		That's interesting. We really have to look at the patient and try to figure out what we're seeing in that particular patient. Victor, we've talked a lot about how rosacea has a tremendous impact on our patients' quality of life. How do you start that conversation with them?</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		I think you used the right word, right from the start, Linda. Having a conversation. For example, patients may come in for their annual visit, and it can manifest itself for the first time. We know age 30 to 50 is primary, but it could be at any time. It's incumbent on myself as a provider to point that out. Or, they may come in for being treated for actinic keratosis or seborrheic dermatitis. It may be also a part of that as well. Third, we just will have that conversation because I've pointed it out. They haven't said a word, and it's not another condition. I think it's really important and incumbent upon us, as providers, to point that out. I can explain the condition, and I can tell you that we have treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		Do you think some of our patients are suffering in silence?</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		I think some of them have probably been discouraged, or feel that maybe there isn't really anything that can be done. Once we explain it and share with them the triggers, things they can do at home, the medications that have a long track record of being effective, slowly, they'll see there's light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		We know there was a very large global survey that was done, trying to get a better understanding of how this disease affects our patients. Can you talk to us a little bit about those findings?</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		I'd be happy to. Over 700 patients who were suffering rosacea were surveyed. They found that half, fifty percent of the patients involved in the study, willing to give up 6 months of their life, to trade in 6 months or more, just to have a cure for rosacea. That was significant.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		That's really saying something significant. What else did they find?</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		They found that 55% indicated that their health problems have impacted their productivity at work. Not only that, they found that 8 out of 10, 86% of patients, modified their behavior so that they can manage their symptoms. Twenty percent, 1 in 5, said that they had to make substantial changes in their socializing, family events, participating with their employees after hours. They were making big life changes because they did not want to put their face forward.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		We know our patients feel like they're being judged. You can imagine sitting in a conference room with your colleagues at an important business meeting, and you have 6 or 7 papules on your face. Are you going to be the one to raise your hand and want to present?</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		That's why it's so important. We may say, "Well, you have 5 or 6, 7 papules. Maybe that's really not important, because I've seen a lot worse as a provider." That's judging. We have to tell them that we're going to take it as serious as they want to.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		Emmy, we know when a patient looks in the mirror and they see a flawed complexion, the first place they go is to the drugstore. And we know our patients buy all kinds of stuff. They have scrubs, they have toners, they have moisturizers with retinol in it, and all kinds of products. And skin care is so essential, and it's really the first step. What advice do you start with when you're talking to your rosacea patients?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		To begin with, I tell them, "Let's keep this simple. Your skin is going to need a simple skin care routine, really gentle things." We want them to use a gentle cleanser, just wash with their hands or a soft cloth, no scrubbing. A gentle moisturizer, something that's bland, avoiding any chemical exfoliants or anti-aging products. And, of course, adding in the sunscreen.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		Consider a rosacea patient is standing in front of you. You had the conversation with them about getting started with the right skin care regiment. Take me to the next step. How do you individualize therapy for that patient?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		Like Victor pointed out, we want to know how much it affects the patient, how severe it is to them. We also want to look at the rosacea and see, is this the erythematotelangiectatic type? Is this the papulopustular type? Is it a combination of both? Our treatment is really going to depend on what subtype of rosacea they have.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		A patient comes in and they have a red face, they have some blood vessels. What's your approach?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		We're a little more limited in treating erythematotelangiectatic rosacea than we are with treating some of the other types. To treat the redness topically, we could use prescription oxymetazoline or brimonidine. Aside from that, we then go to our in-office procedures, such as some of the laser and light-based devices to improve their erythema, to improve those telangiectasias.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		Our treatment options for mild-to-moderate papulopustular rosacea are quite varied. We have several different options that we can choose from. There's topical metronidazole in different formulations, topical azelaic acid, also in different formulations, topical ivermectin cream, and sulfacetamide sulfur in various formulations. And these can all be used in combination rather than just choosing one or the other. You can use a combination of those to treat mild-to-moderate papulopustular rosacea.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		What about with more severe? Where do you go then?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		There are some additional things that we can use. Oral antibiotics can be very helpful. The tetracycline class, particularly doxycycline can be useful. It has a strong anti-inflammatory mechanism of action and so using doxycycline can be helpful. Doxycycline is nice, as well, because we have the option to dose it at sub-antimicrobial dosing, so it is safer to use in the short term and in the long term using low doses to stop that inflammation.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		Can you explain to us why that would be safer than using a full dose doxycycline?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		Sure. Because the low dose of doxycycline is below the minimum inhibitory concentration needed to kill the bacteria, you're not actually killing any bacteria, it's just acting as an anti-inflammatory for rosacea.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		Would you go there even with moderate rosacea?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		Sometimes I do. Especially in combination with the topical agents. I may do a low dose doxycycline plus topical metronidazole plus topical azelaic acid. I think, in part too, this is also where we have to listen to our patients. Some patients want to do multiple steps in their routine and then there might be some patients that tell us that they'll only do 1 or 2 things, and so we need to tailor it to our patients.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		What about oral isotretinoin? Does that ever have a role for you?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		Absolutely. In patients who have more severe papulopustular rosacea, it really can be quite helpful to dose oral isotretinoin for them.</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		Amy brings up a really good teaching point with our patients in that, oftentimes, they'll wonder why are you giving an antibiotic when this is not a bacterial condition?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		Exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		Explaining and taking the time that this is an anti-inflammatory effect and that you will not be on this in a large dose for a long time, and the antimicrobial activity being on a lower base is very important for patients to understand.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		That's a great point.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		What about when somebody comes in with the challenging condition of the phymatous change?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		That's tough. If it is clinically inflamed, meaning there are pustules also with the thickening of the nose or the central facial area, using an oral antibiotic, like doxycycline or isotretinoin, can be helpful to reduce the pustules and papules. If it's just thickened, sebaceous skin, we'll use laser therapies or a surgical approach.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		It sounds like having that conversation with the patient, saying, "We're going to have to treat different areas in different ways. Just because I get your redness and your papules and pustules under control, I'm still going to have to do something else to get the blood vessels under control." I think having that conversation and setting the appropriate expectations upfront is really, really critical.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		Victor, there's so much involved here. How do you set your patients up for success?</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		It starts with the relationship. Honestly, having a conversation where it's very open and trusting and nonjudgmental between provider and client is certainly the foundation for successful relationship, and resolution, if not control, I should say, of rosacea. You can be very overwhelmed with the different creams and lotions and pills and washes that we have out there. But, lasering in exactly what kind of rosacea that they have, and the best treatment by the evidence, will set them up for success.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		It's interesting because even simple instructions are important. For instance, if you're giving somebody an alpha-adrenergic agonist and they work days, tell them, "Don't put it on at night. You put it on in the morning." We assume they know things like that, but sometimes, the keep it simple, explain every detail to them.</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		Usually, the first 30 to 60 days is the time where you'll set up this new habit, but they'll see the success, and they're more likely to maintain that regiment.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		Emmy, we live in a world where everybody wants it yesterday. I can go online and find somebody who's going to promise that they're going to get me better overnight. How do you deal with appropriate patient expectations?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:</strong>		It's important to point out, like you said, that this is not going to get better overnight. It is going to take weeks to months to see improvement, even with daily use of some of these medications. That it is going to be something that they're going to incorporate into their routine for life. This is not a rash that we're going to fix and cure them of permanently. This is more of a skin type that they're prone to. Fortunately, we have some great medicines to help them control it, but there are things that they'll have to continue to use.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		That's really important, because people do come in with a rash. They come in sometimes thinking they have a rash on their face. And I think explaining to the patient, "This is a skin disease." And sometimes, I'll have to use high blood pressure, diabetes as an example, saying, "I'm not going to cure you. But, together, we're going to control this." Explaining that I'm going to do my part, but you have to do your part as well. Victor, any other ways that you manage expectations at all?</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		If I could use 1 word when it comes to rosacea, it would be flares. It's going to happen. I let them know that realistically, when we have those happy times, like let's say it's one of those rosacea patients where it doesn't flare during the winter, as opposed to maybe some others, but then all of a sudden they do, it's okay. We're going to get through that together. This is a flare, we don't give up, we're going to keep going forward. Compliance will be better with that relationship in conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		It's important to let the patient know, "This is not your fault. There's nothing bad that you're doing. You might be exposing yourself to some triggers occasionally, but you have a condition, and as a team, we're going to help you get it under control."</p>

<p>		We've talked about a lot of things today, and we understand the disease itself has a complex pathophysiology. We know there's different types of rosacea. We know that there are different treatments, and we want to target each sign and symptom with the appropriate therapy. Sometimes, we're going to have to use combination treatments. I'm going to look to both of you and, if you were speaking to our colleagues, and with everything that you've learned about this condition, and everything you've learned about the impact that is has on our patients, what key take-home messages would you give to our colleagues to maybe make them a little better in this area?</p>

<p><strong>Dr Graber:	</strong>	I think it's all about setting up realistic expectations and letting the patients know, "I'm going to give you this cream, and this is going to help with the bumps that you have with your rosacea. And I'm going to give you this gel, and this is going to help with the redness." Or, "We're going to do laser, and this is going to help with the redness." Tell patients what they can expect from each of the products, and that it's not going to be just a week or 2, and giving that expectation that we're going to work on this together. It's going to be several weeks and several months until we find something that works for you.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:	</strong>	I use a similar approach. I go back to clinical trials, sometimes when I'm talking to patients, and I explain we do these trials, sometimes over the course of 12 weeks. At week 4, we might see this, at week 8, we might see this, and then at week 12, to kind of give them the appropriate timeline, so they know what to think. Victor, any key messages?</p>

<p><strong>Mr Czerkasij:</strong>		I'm in the second half of my career, and I remember when I was younger and first starting out, I remember talking about rosacea with an older dermatologist and they said, "It's rosacea, it's not cancer." It bothered me, because I know that was bothering the patient that day. And so he was very focused on skin cancer or melanoma, and yet, the person who had a few papules and a little bit of redness, to them, it was important. But it was a brush-off. And to this day, I said, "Let me tell other providers and students that follow me," I try to mentor and say, "If it's important to that patient, it better be very important to you as a provider."</p>

<p><strong>Dr Stein Gold:</strong>		That's critical. The bottom line is, if we don't have that conversation, and we don't create that safe environment that you talk about, we're never going to know, and they're not going to open up to us and let us know exactly how the disease impacts them. I think, if we want to be the best we can be, it's really going to start with having that conversation. As healthcare professionals, we need to talk to our patients about the impact of rosacea on their individual quality of life. Rosacea management should be individualized, based on individual patient needs. Every member of the healthcare team can play a role in rosacea management.</p>

<p>		Emmy, Victor, this has been really a wonderfully informative conversation. I thank you both for taking the time to participate in this activity. And I'd like to thank you for participating in this activity. Please continue on to answer the questions that follow, and complete the evaluation.</p>
