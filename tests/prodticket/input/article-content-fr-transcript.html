<p><strong>NAFLD and NASH in Europe and Canada </strong></p>

<p><strong>Professor M. Quentin Anstee, BSc(Hons), MBBS, PhD, MRCP(UK):</strong> Hello, I'm professor Quentin Anstee. I'm professor of experimental hepatology in the Institute of Cellular Medicine in Newcastle University and an honorary consultant at the Liver Unit at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. Welcome to this program entitled <em>NAFLD and NASH: The Who, the What, and the Where: Global Edition</em>. I'm speaking to you today about the problem of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (also called NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (or NASH) in Europe and Canada. </p>

<p>As a way of brief introduction, NAFLD represents a spectrum of disease that occurs in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. It ranges from isolated hepatic triglyceride accumulation -- what's called steatosis -- to hepatic triglyceride accumulation plus inflammation, sometimes called steatohepatitis or NASH. This occurs in about 10% of patients and can lead on to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and, in some individuals, even on to potentially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).[Anstee, 2013] As you'll hear later in the program, NAFLD affects approximately 25% of the population worldwide.[Younossi, 2019a]</p>

<p>I'm going to begin talking about Europe. As the burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Europe continues to grow, so does the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH. Europe, in fact, has a substantial burden of liver disease which is placing an increasing demand on healthcare systems across the region. And this is only expected to increase across many of these countries. However, there are substantial variations in the epidemiology between countries. </p>

<p>Traditional dogma is that liver disease and cirrhosis are frequently linked to alcohol consumption in Northern European countries and possibly to viral hepatitis in Eastern and Southern European countries. However, this is beginning to change. Given the rise of obesity and diabetes across most of the European countries, even the countries that have historically been considered to have relatively low levels of liver disease are now experiencing an increasing prevalence of NAFLD. The availability of better treatments for viral hepatitis has also reduced the impact for these conditions, so the net effect is that NAFLD is now becoming one of the most common causes of liver disease across the region.</p>

<p>It's also worth remembering that NAFLD is strongly associated with T2D and with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Indeed, there are data to suggest what's been described as a bi-directional relationship: T2D increases the risk of NAFLD, and NAFLD may itself increase the risk of developing T2D, and even CVD.</p>

<p>Estimates vary, but the prevalence of NAFLD is somewhere between 2% and 44% of the general population in Europe and that rises to between 40% and 70% of the people with T2D. Data from a meta-analysis in 2016, in fact, estimated the overall prevalence of NAFLD in adults across Europe is 23.7%.[Younossi, 2016] However, there are several reasons why it's difficult to know the true prevalence of NAFLD. Primarily because there's a lack of high-quality systematic population studies and NAFLD is generally under-reported. This is well evidenced in the largest primary care record study of its kind to date. Pooled data from health records of 17.7 million adults in 4 major European territories were assessed for age- and sex-specific point prevalence and incidence of NAFLD for a decade-long period. The investigators found that rates of recorded NAFLD were much lower than expected and this possibly suggests there is a systematic under-diagnosis and under-reporting of this condition.</p>

<p>This poses the question: why would that be? NAFLD and NASH are under-reported primarily because patients at risk are either not recognized and detected, or they are not being adequately identified. Indeed, being so commonly seen, there is a danger that fatty liver disease is considered a variation of normal and the risk of long-term morbidity and mortality is not recognized by their clinicians. This means patients are potentially missing out on therapies that could improve their healthcare and their long-term outcomes. Supporting this view, a new objective study presented at the EASL International Liver Conference (ILC) in Vienna has just reported that 1 in 5 young adults in a large UK cohort had NAFLD and, of particular concern, 2.4% of these people had elevated FibroScan readings consistent with significant scarring of the liver.[Abeyesekera, 2019]</p>

<p>What is the role of obesity and diabetes? The true prevalence of NAFLD can be inferred from epidemiological surrogate markers, such as the prevalences of obesity and diabetes. Based on the Italian DIONYSOS study, NAFLD was present in two-thirds of patients who had a BMI (body mass index) of between 25 and 30 and up to 94% of individuals with a BMI of greater than 30. Similarly, studies suggest NAFLD is present in approximately 70% of patients with T2D.</p>

<p>Now let's move to the situation in Canada. Once again, NAFLD is the most common liver disease in Canada, affecting up to 25% of the population and that prevalence also appears to be increasing. The specific epidemiology of fatty liver disease in Canada is not well characterized, but much of what we know is inferred from other populations and so it's reasonable to assume, once again, it's linked to obesity and diabetes. It is predicted that increases in NAFLD will parallel increases in obesity and diabetes and, again, overtake levels of viral hepatitis in Canada in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong>NAFLD and NASH in Australia</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jacob George, MBBS, FRACP, PhD, FAASLD:</strong>  Hello, I'm Jacob George from the University of Sydney in Australia and today I'd like to speak to you about the problem of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) in Australia.</p>

<p>As many of you would know, NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease (CLD) among Australians. But even today, there are no precise estimates of the prevalence of the disease, primarily because of a lack of widely available diagnostic tools. However, as in Europe, Canada, and the US, the prevalence of NAFLD is likely to correlate with the prevalence of obesity, which is very well documented through studies such as the AusDiab (Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle) Study.</p>

<p>So what is the role of obesity in fatty liver disease? This map illustrates obesity prevalence in Australia and, as you can see right across the states and territories, the estimated prevalence of obesity in adults was greater than 25%, according to a recent survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and the prevalence rates in men and women are roughly the same. As we all know, obesity is the single leading risk factor for NAFLD with 60% of obese individuals suffering from fatty liver disease.</p>

<p>Similarly, registry data from the Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Liver Transplant Registry show that the prevalence of NASH has increased significantly over the last 2 decades. From 1994 to 2017, for example, it shows that in patients activated for the liver transplant wait list, the prevalence rate of NASH increased from 2% in 2003 to about 11% in 2017. These data highlight that NASH is the third leading cause of CLD among patients waitlisted for liver transplant.</p>

<p>So, what do we know about the natural course of NAFLD? This is a study that was published in <em>Gastroenterology</em> last year by Eduardo Vila-Gomez and he examined the natural history of NAFLD in patients with biopsy-confirmed bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis from NAFLD, and patients were followed until death or liver transplant. Importantly -- for the reasons I'm talking to you about this particular paper -- patients were recruited into this study from Spain, Australia, Hong Kong, and Cuba.</p>

<p>So, what did we find? Firstly, patients with NAFLD and biopsy-proven cirrhosis had higher rates of mortality and liver-related complications than patients with NAFLD and bridging fibrosis. And I guess for many of us, this would be expected. Also, vascular events and nonhepatic malignancies were the most common complications in patients with bridging fibrosis. As expected, patients with diabetes were at higher risk for liver and vascular outcomes, while moderate consumption of alcohol significantly increased the risk of hepatic decompensation, liver cancer, and liver-related death in cirrhotic patients. Of particular interest, however, was the fact that severity of steatosis was inversely related to the severity of liver disease and was an important predictor of survival and hepatic outcomes. The exact mechanism for the protective effect of steatosis was not understood.</p>

<p>So what are the implications of this study? Well, firstly, accurate estimates of the current prevalence and future healthcare burden from NAFLD and NASH in the general Australian population are needed. Secondly, rates of NAFLD and NASH in the Australian indigenous population are unknown, but very important considering the high rates of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and premature death from metabolic and liver disease -- including liver cancer -- in this population. Also, longitudinal studies of children and adolescents with NAFLD would help us understand the long-term outcomes of liver disease and metabolic diseases in general in these populations. Thus, well-designed cohort studies will tell us more about the natural history of NAFLD in order to identify those at the greatest risk of disease progression to liver failure and/or to liver cancer.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>NAFLD and NASH: The Global Epidemic</strong></p>

<p><strong>Zobair M. Younossi, MD, MPH, FACP, FAASLD, AGAF, FACG:</strong> Hello, I'm Dr Zobair Younossi, professor and chairman of the Department of Medicine at Inova Fairfax Medical Campus in Falls Church, Virginia, right outside Washington, DC, in the United States. I'm going to talk to you about the global epidemic of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</p>

<p>It's important to remember that behind the epidemic of NASH, there is actually the root of the problem -- obesity. The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide in every country, and currently there are about 2 billion adults worldwide with obesity and, more concerning, about 350 million children and adolescents who are overweight or obese.</p>

<p><a name="_Hlk9956591"></a>Obesity has a number of complications and the liver complication of obesity is called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This is defined by having excessive fat in the liver of at least 5% or more. But it's really a spectrum that includes not only just having fat, but also steatohepatitis. That means that not only do you have to have fat, but some evidence of liver cell damage and some lobe inflammation. This spectrum ultimately also includes cirrhosis and liver cancer.</p>

<p>The global prevalence of NAFLD from meta-analysis has been estimated to be about 25%. The highest prevalence is in the Middle East and South America, but the prevalence in the US, Europe, and Asia, is somewhere between 25% to 27%. It's more commonly reported in men, and it increases with age.[Younossi, 2019a] The prevalence of NAFLD is also very common in kids -- about 10% of children happen to have NAFLD.[Schwimmer, 2006] Now the more progressive form of NAFLD, which is called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), its prevalence in the general population is not entirely clear but it's estimated to be between 1.5% to 6.5%.</p>

<p>There are a number of important clinical outcomes related to NAFLD. The clinical outcome that is very important to hepatologists is the liver-related outcome; however, it's important to know that cardiac death (or cardiac mortality) is the number 1 cause of death. Of course NASH is now rapidly becoming the most common indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the US, and one of the top causes of liver cancer in cirrhosis in the US. </p>

<p>In fact, when you think about the progression of NASH, it's very different from other diseases because there is actually a process where there is fibrosis progression and regression in the same patient population. So it's hard sometimes to exactly identify which patient at what rate would progress over time. As mentioned, NASH can lead to cirrhosis and will put patients at risk for liver cancer. The rate is about 2% to 3%, so a rate that would require the patient to be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). On the other hand, patients without cirrhosis in NAFLD are also at risk for HCC. That risk is small -- 0.5% per year in a meta-analysis that was recently published.[Anstee, 2013] The rate is there, so you see these patients in the clinic but the rate is low enough that you really cannot screen these patients in a cost-effective fashion in routine clinical practice.</p>

<p>When you look at evidence to support these outcomes and when you look at the biopsy series that was published a few years ago and patients who had a diagnosis of NASH vs non-NASH NAFLD, you will see that patients who had NASH will have higher mortality. The more components of metabolic syndrome you have -- diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia -- the higher your chance of having bad outcomes, including increased mortality. One of the important pieces of information that has come up is that the more advanced the stage of fibrosis you have, the higher the risk of mortality. In fact, stage 2 or higher fibrosis in liver biopsy is an independent predictor of liver<a name="_Hlk9956633"></a>-related mortality. </p>

<p>Now in terms of HCC, looking at data that came out from SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results), which is kept by the National Cancer Institute in the US, you see that out of 5000 patients with HCC, of course HCC was related to viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease (ALD), but also to NAFLD. What's important to note is that, even after controlling for confounders, patients with NAFLD have a worse prognosis in the first year of the diagnosis. That may be because they come in too late, the tumors are too big, and the fact that they do not have assessment by the ultrasound that'd be used for screening HCC.</p>

<p>As mentioned, LT is really changing its profile. Hepatitis C is becoming a less common indication and NAFLD as well as ALD are becoming more and more common indications; and I suspect that currently NASH is the most common indication for LT in the US.[Younossi, 2016] If you look at LT slightly differently where you're looking at those who are actually on the transplant list for an indication of HCC (this is a slightly different patient population), you'll see that in that category of patients, NASH has been the most rapidly growing indication for LT related to HCC.</p>

<p>Other very important and really very concerning data are that when we looked at the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) database over the past 10 years or so and looked at different types of liver disease, you'll see that ALD and hepatitis B remain pretty much stable. On the other hand, hepatitis C shows a decline. In contrast, the prevalence of NAFLD in the US has been continuously and consistently growing over time. Another way to look at outcomes is to look at death record statistics that come from the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for all-cause mortalities and the data between 2007 and 2017. Again, similar to the prevalence rate, you see that most causes of liver disease are pretty much stable. Chronic hepatitis C in recent years has shown a decline in terms of cause of mortality. In contrast, NAFLD is now increasing as a cause of mortality from liver disease.</p>

<p>Another way to look at what's going to be in the future is to model the numbers that we have -- what we are actually looking at in terms of the burden of disease in the future. This is a Markov model estimating the changes between 2015 to 2030 in terms of NASH and NASH-related fibrosis. As you can see, there is going to be a doubling rate of stage 3-related NASH that is advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis-related NASH.</p>

<p>In the curve you can see that all the complications related to NASH -- decompensated cirrhosis, liver cancer, and transplantation -- they're all going to rise over the next 15 years. So it's estimated that by 2030, there's projected to be at about 800,000 excess liver deaths related to NASH. And that's not unique to the US -- there are data now from Europe and some parts of Asia showing almost exactly the same type of trends.</p>

<p>Finally, it's important to remember that liver disease related to obesity (or NAFLD) is associated with a number of other diseases or chronic conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnea. We know, for example, that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is very tightly associated with NAFLD. Recently there's been some suggestion that non-liver-cancer malignancies/solid malignancies are also higher in patients with NAFLD. A study presented about a year ago or so showed that, of course, liver cancer was high in these patients, but stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer were higher in patients with NAFLD than in controls without NAFLD.[Hicks, 2018]</p>

<p>The second type of outcome that we're looking for is patient-reported outcomes (PROs). These are outcomes that come directly from the patients without any modification by anyone else -- quality of life (QoL), for example. And when you look at patients with NASH (and especially those who have advanced fibrosis) and no matter what domain of QoL or PRO that you look for, you'll see that there's a decrement and impairment in QoL and other PROs. This is from a large study and a baseline of patients with biopsy-proven NASH. Why is that important? It's important because if you actually improve NASH, and improve NASH-related fibrosis specifically, you get improvement in PROs and QoL.</p>

<p>Finally, the economic burden of NAFLD, and especially of advanced NASH, is substantial. A Markov model published last year looking at how many patients have advanced NASH (or at least estimated to have advanced NASH): it's about 6.5 million in the US, and a lifetime cost that is almost $100 billion. So it's an expensive disease.</p>

<p>So do we have any treatment or any strategies to decrease the prevalence of NASH and associated challenges that we are facing right now? I think the first thing that's important to remember is that public health intervention will be a part of whatever we do to deal with this disease and that has to target the root of the problem, diabetes and obesity. The second issue that we are dealing with right now is how to identify patients who are at risk. Currently we rely on liver biopsy, but there are a number of noninvasive tests that are currently being tested. But at the moment, we don't have any accurate noninvasive method to detect NASH. So we rely on biopsy, and that has to change so that we can deal with this large cohort of patients that we have.</p>

<p>The current treatment options for NASH are very limited -- lifestyle modification, and pioglitazone and vitamin E have shown to improve a number of different histologic outcomes in patients with NASH. However, none of them are actually approved by the regulatory bodies. But the societies, especially the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), recommend the use in clinical practice.[Chalasani, 2018]</p>

<p>There are a number of products that are in the pipeline for treating NASH, and I'm just going to summarize this that, if you go from left to right, the different targets that actually these drugs will target, including those that are related to insulin resistance, that are related to lipotoxicity, inflammation, cell death, and even fibrosis itself. There are probably about almost 100 different clinical trials, early phase, phase 2. And there are about 4 phase 3 clinical trials that are ongoing. One of them was just recently presented at the International Liver Congress (ILC) 2019 in Vienna. That's obeticholic acid (OCA). It was shown that OCA at 25 mg per day met the fibrosis endpoint, meaning that it improved fibrosis by 1 stage without worsening NASH. This product is now, at least according to the regulatory bodies of the US/the FDA, has met 1 of the 2 primary endpoints actually required for being considered. There were some side effects, which is very common with FXRs (farnesoid X receptor agonists) -- all FXRs, including OCA -- such as itching (which was mostly mild or moderate), as well as some dyslipidemia that, over time of the treatment course, ameliorated and came almost back to the baseline.</p>

<p>This is an exciting time for us because this was the first phase 3 clinical trial that has provided some positive results for patients with NASH. I suspect that there will be a number of other drugs coming together. And what we're hoping is that a number of these drugs can be actually combined as combination therapies. But at the end of the day, the combination therapies will be given probably for shorter periods of time and we will probably have to treat NASH as a chronic disease, such as diabetes, so a maintenance regimen probably will be required.</p>

<p>I hope I've shown you that obesity is promoted by a number of environmental factors that have led to the growing epidemic of NASH and its complications. NASH negatively impacts clinical, economic, and patient-reported outcomes. In order to identify patients with NASH who are at a high risk for progression, we need to develop accurate and validated noninvasive tests. But to deal with the epidemic of NASH, a multiprong approach that considers not only the public health program, as well as medical interventions in a multidisciplinary team approach. Finally, for some patients with NASH, drug regimens will be needed. Although current treatment options are limited, a number of regimens are in the pipeline, and some of those were just recently presented at the ILC in Vienna.</p>
