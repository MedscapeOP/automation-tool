Based on previous research, there is a wide distribution of outcomes for patients with normal modified rankin scores (mRS) that pertain to physical function, fatigue, cognition and social function. It is important to understand the outcomes that are most meaningful to patients as it will help in identifying meaningful treatment and rehabilitation options for each patient."
