<ol>
    <li>Describe the impact in splicing factorâ€“mutant myelodysplastic syndromes of splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), and U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1) mutations on pre-mRNA splicing in purified bone marrow stem and progenitor cells, according to a comprehensive systematic analysis</li>
    <li>Determine the associations between aberrantly spliced isoforms and clinical variables and patient survival, according to a comprehensive systematic analysis</li>
    <li>Explain the functional impact of aberrant splicing of key target genes on erythroid cell growth and differentiation, according to a comprehensive systematic analysis</li>

This activity is designed to be completed within the time designated on the title page; physicians should claim only those credits that reflect the time actually spent in the activity. To successfully earn credit, participants must complete the activity online during the valid credit period that is noted on the title page. To receive <em>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit&amp;trade;</em>, you must receive a minimum score of 70% on the post-test.<br/><br/>
Follow these steps to earn CME/CE credit*: </p>
<ol>
<li>Read the target audience, learning objectives, and author disclosures.</li>
<li>Study the educational content online or printed out.</li>
<li>Online, choose the best answer to each test question. To receive a certificate, you must receive a passing score as designated at the top of the test. We encourage you to complete the Activity Evaluation to provide feedback for future programming.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may now view or print the certificate from your CME/CE Tracker. You may print the certificate but you cannot alter it. Credits will be tallied in your CME/CE Tracker and archived for 6 years; at any point within this time period you can print out the tally as well as the certificates from the CME/CE Tracker.<br/><br/>
