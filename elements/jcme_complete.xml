                        <em>Cryptococcus gattii</em> traditionally infects immunocompetent hosts and causes devastating pulmonary or central nervous system disease.

He also had headaches, photophobia, and subjective syncope. The patient had a CD4+ T-cell count of 6 cells/mm

At admission, initial workup included a barium swallow procedure and kidney, ureter, and bladder radiography. These procedures showed no unusual findings.

After detection of a serum CrAg titer &gt;1:2,560, a lumbar puncture (LP) was performed on day 4 of hospitalization. The LP showed an opening pressure of 24 cm of water, 5 leukocytes/mm

                    <p>A 47-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension and infection with HIV was admitted to Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital because of a 2-week history of fever, nausea, headaches, and unsteady gait. Outpatient records showed a CD4+ T-cell count of &lt;20 cells/mm
                        
                        
                        <sup>3</sup> and an HIV-1 RNA level of 1,653 copies/mL, for which he was recently given ART. This therapy consisted of emtricitabine (200 mg 1×/d), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg 1×/d), raltegravir (400 mg 2×/d), and etravirine (200 mg 2×/d).
                    
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>MRI of the brain performed at admission was unremarkable, with no definitive evidence of acute ischemic, intracranial hematoma, or enhancing intracranial lesion. Initially, the patient was given levofloxacin for treatment of possible sinusitis, but he continued to experience intermittent episodes of fever and persistent headaches. On day 2 after admission, an LP was performed and showed increased opening pressure, 85 leukocytes/mm

                    <p>The positive finding for CrAg prompted initiation of induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, which consisted of IV liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg/d) and oral flucytosine (25 mg/kg 4×/d).

The patient was given IV dexamethasone (4 mg every 6 h) because of recurrent headaches. Before completion of 14 days of induction therapy, a repeat LP was performed and showed an opening pressure of 43 cm of water, a closing pressure of 30 cm of water, 97 leukocytes/mm

                    <p>The patient was discharged and received voriconazole and a dexamethasone taper over a 6-week period. Voriconazole was continued for 6 months and was chosen for the consolidation phase of treatment because there is some evidence that the MIC of voriconazole is lower than the MIC of fluconazole for most

                    <p>A 47-year-old man with a history of depression and infection with HIV for ≈20 years was admitted to Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital because of suicidal ideation caused by persistent pain. He also reported body aches, fatigue, and weakness for a 1-month duration, but denied pulmonary symptoms or fevers. He was previously receiving ART, but had been noncompliant for the previous 2 years because of homelessness.</p>
                    <p>At admission, initial examination showed a CD4+ T-cell count of 26 cells/mm

The patient was given IV amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/d) and oral flucytosine (25 mg/kg 4×/d). An LP showed 3 leukocytes/mm

                    <p>Because of these findings, we performed computed tomography (CT) of the chest and identified a mass (4.0 cm × 2.5 cm) with central cavitation in the right lower lobe abutting the pleural surface (Figure). The patient underwent a CT-guided lung biopsy to evaluate the right lower lobe mass. Pathologic examination demonstrated fibrous tissue and numerous cystic spaces containing macrophages and variably sized organisms with a thick capsule that were strongly positive when stained with Grocott’s methanamine silver special stain. The morphologic features were consistent with those of a

A CT of his abdomen and pelvis to evaluate lower abdominal pain was performed ≈6 months later and showed resolution of the initial mass. We detected a new 20-mm lesion within the right lower lobe, which was not observed in previous studies.

                <em>Cryptococcus gattii</em> complex infection, southeastern United States. Transverse (A) and frontal (B) views without intravenous contrast showed a mass (arrows) (4.0 cm × 2.5 cm) that had central cavitation posteriorly in the right lower lobe abutting the pleural surface. The central cavitary portion of this lesion had a maximum length of ≈1.3 cm and no evidence of fluid level or internal soft tissues.
