                    <p style="min-height: 230px;">Maya, a 33-year-old woman, presents to her primary care clinician with complaints of severe and spontaneous sweating on underarms and hands. Symptoms have persisted since childhood and do not respond to over-the-counter (OTC) antiperspirants. She recently discussed the problem with a pharmacist, who recommended seeing a clinician. She appears nervous, wiping her hand on the examining gown prior to shaking hands with the clinician.</p>
                    <p>Sweating impacts her job as a notary, causing difficulty with holding a pen and shaking hands with clients. She lives and works in a semirural section of the Southeast United States, where humidity is high. Wearing black to hide sweat stains is both unfashionable and uncomfortably warm. Her husband makes what she views as insensitive jokes about her sweating. He suggests that she shower and change clothes more often, or that she lose weight. Losing about 10 lb several years did not reduce her sweating. She has regained the weight.</p>
                    <p>Her medical history is significant for obesity (5'7", 198 lb; body mass index [BMI], 31 kg/m
                        <sup>2</sup>) since adolescence. She has no other medical conditions and takes no medications.

                    <p>HH is characterized by sweating in excess of what is required to maintain body temperature.
                        <sup type="ref">[1]</sup> Lifetime prevalence rates of 1.0% to 1.6% have been reported for the United States and United Kingdom, respectively, based on healthcare databases.
                        <sup type="ref">[2]</sup> A US-based online survey yielded a self-reported prevalence rate of 4.8%.
                        <sup type="ref">[3]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>HH can be focal or generalized. Commonly affected focal sites include the palmar and plantar areas, the axillae, and the craniofacial, inguinal, and gluteal areas.
                        <sup type="ref">[4,5]</sup> Nearly two-thirds of patients reported a family history of the condition in 2 series (62% and 65%), suggesting a genetic basis for the disease in at least some cases.
                        <sup type="ref">[6,7]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>The pathophysiology of HH is not well understood but the condition is thought to be caused by sympathetic overstimulation of the eccrine sweat glands.
                        <sup type="ref">[8]</sup> Individuals with HH have higher expression of acetylcholine and Î±-7 neuronal nicotinic receptor subunits in the sympathetic ganglia, as well as larger-diameter thoracic sympathetic ganglia, compared with non-HH controls.
                        <sup type="ref">[9]</sup> Increased acetylcholine expression in the ganglia may relate to hyperactivity of the central portion of the sympathetic nervous system.
                        <sup type="ref">[9,10]</sup> Sweat glands of patients with primary HH (ie, HH not related to medications or other medical conditions) are normal in size and number.
                        <sup type="ref">[10]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>HH significantly impacts patients' functionality and quality of life. Beyond the substantial embarrassment and anxiety that patients report (85% and 71%, respectively),
                        <sup type="ref">[3]</sup> 63% note occupational impairment and more than 50% describe moderate to severe effect on personal relationships and social situations.
                        <sup type="ref">[11]</sup> The condition also affects choice of exercise and recreational pursuits (eg, playing musical instruments, knitting), and for patients with palmar HH, many manual activities (opening jars, using hand tools, handing things to people).
                        <sup type="ref">[12]</sup> Patients often describe repeated daily showering, changing clothes, and antiperspirant applications in an effort to offset the effects of excessive sweating, which is unrelated to personal hygiene.
                        <sup type="ref">[11,12]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>Primary HH presents differently than HH secondary to medical conditions or medications.</p>

                        <strong></strong>concluded that meeting the following criteria was associated with a 99% sensitivity and 82% specificity for diagnosing primary HH: focal, visible sweating that is excessive compared with thermoregulatory need, persisting for at least 6 months 
                        <em>and </em>at least

                        <strong></strong>More than 93% of patients in this evaluation (387/415) had primary HH; the rest had secondary HH.

                    <p>Maya reports experiencing excessive sweating episodes multiple times each week since early childhood. The sweating affects both underarms and both hands equally. Excessive sweating occurs during both calm and stressful situations and at all times of the day, with no identifiable triggers. It does not occur during sleep. Maya reports that excessive sweating and the fear and anxiety around whether she will sweat causes her significant stress. She knows of no family history of the disorder. Physical examination reveals beads of sweat pooling in the palms and wet rings on the exam gown in the axillary area.</p>
                    <p>Maya keeps wipes and towels in her desk at work to clean off her hands prior to scheduled client meetings but walk-ins can catch her unprepared. She stores a towel in her car to help with gripping the steering wheel and uses a paperweight rather than her hand to hold down documents while signing them. She feels disadvantaged at business and social functions, where she is reluctant to shake hands, share meals, or hold a cocktail glass.</p>

                        <em>Iontophoresis. </em>This therapy involves delivering 15 to 20 milliamps of current through tap water, with patients placing hands or feet in water trays.
                        <sup type="ref">[1]</sup> The reasons for its efficacy in palmar and plantar HH are unclear but iontophoresis has a long history of safety and efficacy. Patients typically use the therapy at home 3 to 4 times weekly, followed by maintenance therapy of once weekly or less.
                        <sup type="ref">[20,30,31]</sup> Covering the skin -- especially nonintact skin -- with petroleum jelly before therapy can prevent erythema or vesiculation. Other side effects include burning sensation or "pins and needles." Crushed anticholinergic tablets (eg, glycopyrrolate) can be added to the water.
                        <sup type="ref">[31]</sup> Nearly 80% of patients reported improvement with iontophoresis after 2 weeks (HDSS).

                    <p>The clinician reviewed the treatment options with Maya and asked her preference about mode and frequency of administration as well as side effect profile. As Maya wishes to start with the most conservative therapy, they agree to begin with a prescription-strength antiperspirant (20% aluminum chloride hexahydrate). The clinician counsels Maya to apply the antiperspirant at night to completely dry skin, in order to reduce the risk of irritation.

                    <p>The clinician conducts a detailed review of how Maya was using the antiperspirant. Maya was applying the medication at night after all activities, when she was completely dry. She had not shaved her underarms on the days she used the medication. Therefore, she was deemed intolerant to the treatment.</p>
                    <p>The clinician proposes the recently approved topical glycopyrrolate cloth and off-label topical oxybutynin 10% gel as the next possible options. Maya expresses impatience with topicals and asks about trying an oral anticholinergic agent. The clinician suggests initiation of an oral glycopyrrolate at a dose of 2 mg/day, with optional titration to twice daily after 1 week and 3 times daily after another week if needed for symptom control. In response to the clinician's question, Maya states that she uses birth control and does not plan to become pregnant.</p>
                    <p>Acknowledging that Maya is not impressed with topical interventions, the clinician asks that she consider continuing to use an OTC antiperspirant. Combination therapy may enable symptom control with a lower dose of anticholinergic medication, thus reducing the risk of systemic anticholinergic side effects (eg, dry mouth, dry eyes, constipation, and urinary retention). The patient agrees and decides to go back to applying an OTC 6.25% aluminum chloride product at night. A follow-up visit is scheduled for 2 months, though this can be postponed to 6 months if disease control is adequate.</p>

                    <p style="min-height: 230px;">Peter, a 12-year-old boy, presents to a dermatologist with complaints of severe and spontaneous sweating on his underarms, hands, and feet. His mother, who accompanies Peter to the visit and has seen clinicians in the same dermatology practice, states that she has the same symptoms. After reading about HH, she realizes that new options may be available. She had asked Peter if he would like to see someone in the practice; Peter had indicated a strong preference for seeing the male rather than the female dermatologist.</p>
                    <p>The mother states that Peter has always sweated more than other kids but that this has become more of an issue since Peter's stepmother began to complain about it. Peter's father remarried about a year ago. The parents have joint custody, and Peter spends about 10 days each month with his dad and stepmom. The stepmom complains about the odor of Peter's shoes, socks, and T shirts. Peter becomes very anxious when it is time to go to his dad and stepmom's home.</p>
                    <p>When asked, Peter monosyllabically agrees that he changes his socks and shirt when he arrives home from school, and sometimes changes his socks mid-day for gym class. He says his classmates make fun of his smelly shoes and socks. He stands on the sidelines during most gym activities as he cannot grip a bat or ball. Sometimes he slips when running.</p>
                    <p>The mother states that she sympathizes with Peter's difficulties. A high-strength OTC antiperspirant improved his sweating somewhat in elementary school but symptoms worsened with the onset of puberty.</p>

                    <p>The dermatologist asks Peter and his mother about Peter's history of symptoms and patterns of their occurrence. Peter indicates that excessive heat and humidity and stress worsen symptoms, though symptoms also occur in cool, dry temperatures and calm situations. He sweats on both sides of the body equally, though only on palms of his hands, soles of his feet, and underarms. He has no symptoms during sleep.</p>
                    <p>His mother says that Peter does not wish to attend his middle school dances. She wonders if he is afraid of being mocked for his excess sweating. He says he attended a dance after his stepmom coerced him into going and it was a "disaster." The mother states that Peter socializes less since entering middle school. He does not go to the beach with friends and wears closed-toe shoes in warm weather as he has slipped in flip-flops.</p>
                    <p>Physical examination reveals sweat pooling on the palms, dripping from the feet, and staining the axillary areas of the gown. Peter generally looks at the floor, speaks in a low, barely understandable volume, and does not shake the doctor's hand when it is offered.</p>
                    <p>Although Peter's age of symptom onset and family history of HH support a diagnosis of primary HH, it is important to rule out the most likely causes of secondary HH. Use of relevant medications, as well as risk of endocrine disorders such as diabetes or of lymphoma, can be quickly assessed with a few questions.</p>

Neither Peter nor his mother feel that the medication has helped him.</p>

                    <p>Peter is diagnosed with primary axillary, palmar, and plantar HH, possibly aggravated by SSRI therapy. The dermatologist explains to Peter that his sweating is not a variation of normal but a not-uncommon and treatable medical condition. He asks Peter and his mother to consider the office a safe medical environment and to call with any questions or concerns about his sweating.</p>
                    <p>He suggests that Peter change socks midday as well as at gym class and upon returning home from school. He recommends trying flip-flops with a moisture-absorbing footbed.</p>
                    <p>The dermatologist reviews treatment options with Peter and his mother (
                        <strong>Table 2</strong>), eliciting patient and parent concerns and priorities. Peter's mother prefers that he start with topical therapy to maximize safety. Peter is most concerned about efficacy and minimal interference with his routine (eg, not having to apply a topical at school).
                    </p>
                    <p>Peter, his mother and the dermatologist agree to start with a prescription strength antiperspirant (20% aluminum chloride hexahydrate). The dermatologist instructs Peter to assess tolerability by applying the medication to a small area under his left axillae for 1 week to completely dry skin, about 20 minutes before showering. If no rash or irritation develops, then he should apply the medication to all affected areas (palms, soles, and axillae) while in bed, when the skin is completely dry. The dermatologist suggests leaving a towel and the medication at bedside so that Peter can dry off when he gets into bed and then apply the medication while he is in bed. He counsels Peter than no potentially sweat-inducing activities should occur after the medication is applied.</p>
                    <p>A follow-up visit is scheduled for 4 weeks. Peter and his mother are urged to call the office immediately if irritation or rash develops, and anytime with questions or concerns.</p>

                    <p>Peter indicates that the antiperspirant helps his hands and feet but does not alleviate his axillary sweating. It also causes some irritation on his underarms. The dermatologist again reviews treatment options and elicits patient and parent concerns and priorities. Peter's mother still prefers a topical to a systemic therapy and expresses concern about treatment side effects. Peter reiterates that he does not want a treatment that he must use at school.</p>

                    <p>The patient, mother, and dermatologist agree to try the topical glycopyrrolate cloth, an anticholinergic medication that works differently than the antiperspirant. However, like the antiperspirant, it is noninvasive and used once daily. Peter has no contraindications to this therapy. The dermatologist counsels Peter to use the cloth only on his axillae, as it is FDA approved only for that purpose.
                        <sup type="ref">[27]</sup> The dermatologist suggests that Peter continue using the antiperspirant on his hands and feet, as it relieves symptoms without irritation in those areas. He instructs Peter to use glycopyyrolate cloth when he gets in bed at night, when the skin is clean and completely dry. Peter and his mother agree to try the cloth. The dermatologist explains the most common side effects, including local skin reactions (31%), dry mouth (24%), application site pain (9%), mydriasis (7%), blurred vision (4%), and urinary hesitation (4%) (frequency in clinical trials).
                        <sup type="ref">[15]</sup> He instructs Peter to schedule a follow-up visit for 8 to 12 weeks, and to call if side effects develop or other concerns arise.

                    <p>At the 8- to 12-week follow-up visit, Peter reports substantial improvement in his palmar, plantar, and axillary sweating. He has experienced no side effects. He tries to keep some of the premoistened topical glycopyrrolate cloths at his dad's house and some at his mom's house so that he need not worry about forgetting to pack them.</p>
