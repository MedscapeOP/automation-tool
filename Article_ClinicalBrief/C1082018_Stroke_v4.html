<p>For stroke victims, the outcomes that matter to clinicians are often not the outcomes that matter most to survivors. Based on previous research, there is a wide distribution of outcomes for patients with normal modified rankin scores (mRS) that pertain to physical function, fatigue, cognition and social function. It is important to understand the outcomes that are most meaningful to patients as it will help in identifying meaningful treatment and rehabilitation options for each patient. </p>

<p>Recurrence, mortality, and disability are the outcomes most commonly measured in patients with ischemic stroke, but multiple nonphysical domains of health are also affected and are not specifically captured by measuring disability. These include social roles, fatigue, depression, anxiety, pain, cognition, physical function, and sleep disturbances, which may significantly reduce quality of life.</p>

<p>The goals of this large observational cohort study by Katzan and colleagues in patients with ischemic stroke were to measure patient-reported health for 8 domains across levels of disability compared with each other and with the US general population, and to evaluate the association of demographic and clinical factors with patient-reported health, using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Among patients with a wide range of diseases and symptoms, PROMIS efficiently measures patient status for different domains of health along a continuous scale.</p>

<p><a name="Heading54"></a><strong>Study Synopsis and Perspective</strong></p>

<p>A new study by Katzan and colleagues, highlights some of the more common nonphysical problems experienced by patients after they have an ischemic stroke, with some surprising findings.</p>

<p>The study, which examined patient-reported information collected systematically at the Cleveland Clinic cerebrovascular clinic from 2015 to 2017, found that after physical function, the domains most affected in patients with ischemic stroke were satisfaction with social roles (eg, the ability to do domestic tasks, go out and socialize, and go to work) and executive function.</p>

<p>"While we would all expect physical function to be impacted by stroke, satisfaction with social roles and executive function are not as well appreciated as being common problems after stroke. We actually found that these were much more common than anxiety and depression, which was quite surprising," lead author, Irene L. Katzan, MD, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, told&#160;<em>Medscape Medical News</em>.</p>

<p>"Even if patients don't have an obvious physical disability after a stroke -- so on the surface they appear normal -- they often suffer from these less obvious issues which can have a large effect on quality of life. While they may be able to get to the grocery store, they may have problems organizing a list or paying for their goods or they may feel too fatigued to go out at all," she said.&#160;</p>

<p>"While many centers will systematically screen for depression after stroke, I don't think we routinely think about satisfaction with social roles and executive function as common problems for stroke patients," Dr Katzan added. "Our results suggest that we should. While there is no quick fix for these problems, we can provide suggestions on how to cope better maybe, in programs aimed at integrating people back into society again."</p>

<p>The study was&#160;<a href="http://n.neurology.org/content/early/2018/03/28/WNL.0000000000005327">published online</a>&#160;in&#160;<em>Neurology</em>&#160;on March 28.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p>Dr Katzan explained that although it is well known that stroke affects lives in many different ways, usually patients are assessed by using limited scores that don't take account of multiple factors occurring together and how they interact with each other.</p>

<p>"The main scale used to assess stroke patients -- the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) -- is quite a crude scale with only seven different categories and is heavily weighted towards mobility. It doesn't differentiate the impact of things like sleep, cognition, anxiety, and depression on day-to-day life."&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>For the current study, the researchers analyzed information from 1195 patients with stroke by using PROMIS, which captures patient responses for physical function, satisfaction with social roles, fatigue, anxiety, depression, pain interference, and sleep disturbance. Scores are calibrated to the US general population, which aids in the clinical interpretation of results.</p>

<p>Additional information on executive function was derived from response to the Neuro-Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) executive function scale.</p>

<p>The most affected domains were physical function (T score, 58.8), satisfaction with social roles (T score, 55.4), and executive function (T score, 53.4).</p>

<p>PROMIS scores for all domains except depression and sleep disturbance were worse than in the general population; however, patients with an mRS score of zero (no symptoms) were not worse than the general population on any of the 8 domains measured.</p>

<p>Disability, lower income, and female sex were associated with worse scores in multiple domains. Age was associated with worse physical function but lower anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance.</p>

<p>Patient-reported health worsened with increasing levels of disability in all domains, although to varying degrees.</p>

<p>A graded response of worsening physical function, worsening executive function, and worsening satisfaction with social roles was correlated with the mRS and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Although fatigue, depression, pain, and anxiety had modest correlations and sleep disturbance had only a slight correlation with disability, scores remained relatively stable in patients with disability levels ranging from mild to severe (mRS score, 2-5).</p>

<p>"Our findings that domains of health are differentially affected with increasing levels of disability support the value of assessing individual domains of health in stroke patients, regardless of stroke severity," the researchers said.&#160;</p>

<p>"The results of this study, which represents one of the largest analyses of patient-reported outcomes after stroke collected as part of routine care, improve our understanding of the well-being of patients with ischemic stroke compared to the general population and bring attention to the importance of social roles and executive function for stroke survivors," they concluded.</p>

<p>In an&#160;accompanying editorial, Mary G. George, MD, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, and Xingquan Zhao, MD, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, Beijing, China, said the study "sheds light on understanding how survivors of ischemic stroke differ from the general population across multiple health domains that can be useful in improving the clinician's understanding of patients' challenges and needs, as well as addressing outcomes that matter most to patients."<sup>[2]</sup></p>

<p><strong>Study Highlights</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	The observational cohort for this study consisted of 1195 patients in a cerebrovascular clinic from February 17, 2015 to January 27, 2017.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Mean age was 62&#177;15 years; 81% were white; median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at the clinic visit was 1 (interquartile range, 0-2).</p>

<p>&#8226;	As part of their routine care, all these patients completed Neuro-QoL executive function and PROMIS scales of physical function, satisfaction with social roles, fatigue, anxiety, depression, pain interference, and sleep disturbance.</p>

<p>&#8226;	The percentage of patients with scores meaningfully worse than the general population ranged from 28% for sleep disturbance to 63% for physical function. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Patients with higher mRS scores had worse PROMIS scores, but correlation varied, ranging from <em>r</em> =0.16 for sleep disturbance to <em>r</em> =0.52 for physical function. </p>

<p>&#8226;	The most affected domains among patients with stroke were physical function (T score, 58.8), satisfaction with social roles (T score, 55.4), and executive function (T score, 53.4). </p>

<p>&#8226;	Correlations were modest for fatigue, depression, pain, and anxiety, which are likely affected by multiple psychosocial factors, including coping styles, social support, and economic burden.</p>

<p>&#8226;	For all domains except depression and sleep disturbance, PROMIS scores were worse than in the general population, but patients with mRS score of zero (no symptoms) were not worse than the general population on any reported domains.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Scores remained relatively stable in patients with disability levels ranging from mild to severe (mRS score, 2-5). </p>

<p>&#8226;	Factors associated with worse scores in multiple domains were disability, lower income, and female sex. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Older age was associated with worse physical function but with lower scores for anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Based on their findings, the investigators concluded that compared with the general US population, patients with ischemic stroke seen in ambulatory clinics reported worse function across multiple domains of health.</p>

<p>&#8226;	The symptom domains most often affected were physical function, satisfaction with social roles, and executive function whereas anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance were less common in this cohort</p>

<p>&#8226;	At higher levels of disability, these symptoms were proportionately more common, with the correlation varying by symptom. </p>

<p>&#8226;	The emotional burden of stroke may be greater in younger patients because of greater societal demands related to work and social roles as family provider or parent.</p>

<p>&#8226;	The investigators suggested that their findings enhance understanding of the well-being of patients with ischemic stroke and highlight the importance of social roles and executive function for stroke survivors.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Although physical limitations are well recognized after stroke and are typically most often targeted by rehabilitation, social participation and cognitive functioning may not always be addressed or even recognized.</p>

<p>&#8226;	The mRS, which is most often used to evaluate disability after stroke, is heavily weighted toward mobility and does not incorporate disturbances in sleep, cognition, anxiety, and depression.    </p>

<p>&#8226;	Interventions to increase social participation, particularly those involving exercise, have been shown to be effective.</p>

<p>&#8226;	In contrast, cognitive impairment after stroke may not benefit from rehabilitation. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Still, social support programs and strategies that accommodate patients&#8217; level of cognitive functioning may be helpful.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Stroke centers and clinicians caring for patients with stroke of all degrees of severity should assess for problems with social participation and cognitive functioning and other health domains and offer appropriate interventions, particularly as different domains of health are differentially affected with increasing levels of disability. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Although sleep disturbance was the least affected of the reported domains, more than half of patients with stroke are known to have sleep-disordered breathing, accompanied by worse functional status and increased mortality.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Lack of sleepiness and snoring reported by other patients with sleep-disordered breathing hinders screening patients with stroke for this condition and may partially explain why sleep disturbance was the least affected domain in this study.</p>

<p>&#8226;	This study is one of the largest analyses to date of patient-reported outcomes after stroke collected as part of routine care, which increases the generalizability of the findings.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Nonetheless, study limitations include lack of assessment of several other domains affected by stroke, including communication and other aspects of cognition; study cohort from a single institution with patients who predominantly had mild stroke; and possible selection bias. </p>

<p>&#8226;	An accompanying editorial noted differences in the health domain outcomes depending on the timing of measurement of outcome after stroke, suggesting a possible need to repeat assessments over time and to monitor outcomes that are most important to patients.</p>

<p><strong>Clinical Implications</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Compared with the general US population, patients with ischemic stroke seen in ambulatory clinics reported worse function across multiple domains of health, including certain nonphysical domains.</p>

<p>&#8226;	The findings enhance understanding of the well-being of patients with ischemic stroke and highlight the importance of social roles and executive function for stroke survivors.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Implications for the Healthcare Team: Although physical limitations are well recognized after stroke and are typically most often targeted by rehabilitation, social participation and cognitive functioning may not always be addressed or even recognized.</p>

<p>D. Older age was associated with worse scores for anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance</p>

<p>Answer: Correlations of mRS scores with PROMIS scores were modest for fatigue, depression, pain, and anxiety, which are likely affected by multiple psychosocial factors, including coping styles, social support, and economic burden. Factors associated with worse scores in multiple domains were disability, lower income, and female sex. Older age was associated with worse physical function but with lower scores for anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. The emotional burden of stroke may be greater in younger patients because of greater societal demands related to work and social roles as family provider or parent.</p>



-----------------

<p>2. Based on the large observational cohort study by Katzan and colleagues, which of the following statements about clinical implications of findings regarding patient-reported health following ischemic stroke is correct?</p>

<p>A. Problems with social participation and cognitive functioning after ischemic stroke are generally well recognized, and appropriate rehabilitation is offered</p>

<p>B. The mRS is a good tool to measure nonphysical issues after stroke</p>

<p>C. Interventions to increase social participation, particularly those involving exercise, have been shown to be effective</p>

<p>D. Rehabilitation for cognitive impairment after stroke is highly beneficial</p>

<p>Answer: Although physical limitations are well recognized after stroke and are typically most often targeted by rehabilitation, social participation and cognitive functioning may not always be addressed or even recognized. The mRS, which is most often used to evaluate disability after stroke, is heavily weighted towards mobility and does not incorporate disturbances in sleep, cognition, anxiety, and depression. Cognitive impairment after stroke may not benefit from rehabilitation, but social support programs and strategies that accommodate patients&#8217; level of cognitive functioning may be helpful. Stroke centers and clinicians caring for patients with stroke of all degrees of severity should assess for problems with social participation and cognitive functioning, as well as other health domains, and offer appropriate interventions.</p>
