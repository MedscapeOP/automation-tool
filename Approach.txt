---------------------- GENERAL OVERVIEW  
- Convert prodticket to text/html file 
- Read in the key strings/data from this file and store 
in variables.
    - Assign the string values to JavaScript Object properties 
        - These properties should correlate to the xml node where 
          they are to be inserted.  
    - Example: 
    var activityTitle = getTitleFn(prodticket);
    var fileData = {title: activityTitle, contrbtr_byline: "Man"};
- Utilize either "xml2js" package OR "xml-js" package 
  to build the new xml file with the values now updated.
    - Example: 
    var builder = new xml2js.Builder();
    var newXmlFile = builder.buildObject(fileData);
    fs.writeFile(__dirname + "/article.xml", newXmlFile, function(err) {
        if(err) {
            return console.log(err);
        }
        console.log("The new file was created!");
    }); 
- Then simply copy the contents of the new file and replace it in D2. 

---------------------- CREATING THE COMMAND LINE PROGRAM/UI 
- There are 2 Options I have used in the past:
    1) Gulp task runner
        - Easier to set up processes and it is easier to configure out of the box 
        - Less user friendly than vorpal
        - Possibly less granular control.  
    2) Vorpal
