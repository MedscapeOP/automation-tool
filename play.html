<li>It is unknown why certain patients achieve different responses</li>

<li>There are several factors, which have been identified, that can help predict a response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment</li>

<!-- BULLET -->
<li>	Some differences occur once a patient has achieved a response

<!-- SUB-BULLET -->
<ul><li>	Some patients maintain the response indefinitely</li>

<!-- SUB-BULLET -->
<li>    Others lose response	

<!-- SUB-SUB-BULLET -->
<ul><li>Some lose the response gradually, and some seem to lose response quite suddenly</li></ul></li>

<!-- SUB-BULLET -->
<li>	There may be a role for doing an ADA test in these different subsets of patients

<!-- SUB-SUB-BULLET -->
<ul><li>More research is needed to determine the optimal place for ADA testing</li></ul></li></ul></li>
