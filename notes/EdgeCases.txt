    EXAMPLE INPUT: 
        <p>&lt;&lt;insert slide 46; 49:21 &gt;&gt;  </p>

        <p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Eric: Is There Anything He Hasn't Tried?</strong></p>

        <p>&#8226;	Toolbox of options is not enough</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Don't work in all patients</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Can cause a lot of side effects</p>

        <p>&#8226;	Patients are treated by trial and error</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Warn patients that it may take a few tries to find a treatment that works</p>

        <p>&#8226;	Eric cycled through multiple medications</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Cyproheptadine</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Nortriptyline caused orthostatic hypotension</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Divalproex sodium caused nosebleeds</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Topiramate, gabapentin, pregabalin</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Steroids cased irritability</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Dexamethasone, indomethacin</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Duloxetine caused dizziness and orthostatic hypotension</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Methergine, tizanidine</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Buprenorphine patch when attacks worsened</p>

        <p><tt>o	</tt>Fentanyl patch caused withdrawal symptoms</p>

        <p>&#9642;	Hospitalization for intravenous infusions of dihydroergotamine, magnesium, prochlorperazine, diphenhydramine, levetiracetam, but caused encephalopathy</p>

    OUTPUT: 
        <li>	Hospitalization for intravenous infusions of dihydroergotamine, magnesium, prochlorperazine, diphenhydramine, levetiracetam, but caused encephalopathy

- Variation: Insert slide vs "slide" 
    - <p><strong>&lt;&lt;slide 75 vs. <p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide 75

- Variation: Capitalization 
    - <p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2 vs <p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2

- TODO: as of 8/16/18
    - Remove - </strong> <strong> after formatting slides 
    - FORMAT LISTS(): DONE 
        - Wrap lists in <ul></ul> 
            - shouldn't rely on D2 to wrap list in <ul>  


ANOTHER EDGE CASE 1: 
<p><strong>&lt;&lt;insert slide [18]; 17:35&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Considerations for Patients With Loss of Response to Biologic Therapy</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	There is still a great deal to discuss regarding how best to use ADA testing</p>

<p>&#8226;	While it is not practical or cost-efficient to test all patients, ADA testing can provide information in certain patient populations, including patients who are not responding to treatment with a biologic agent</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>If the patient has no/low drug concentration, measure ADAs</p>

<p>&#9642;	If a high ADA titer is found, the drug is likely being cleared because of immunogenicity</p>

<p>&#9642;	The drug mechanism is not failing, but the specific drug is failing; can switch from 1 anti-TNF agent to another</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>If the patient&#8217;s drug concentration is at a good level, then consider that the target is blocked (drug mechanism is failing)</p>

<p>&#9642;	Switch to a drug with a different mechanism of action</p>

<p>&#8226;	If the patient is responding well, but a low drug concentration is present, there are 2 explanations</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>The patient is doing well and not taking his or her drugs </p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>The patient is doing well despite making ADAs and clearing the drug</p>

<p>&#9642;	In this case, there is no benefit to continuing the drug </p>

Expected Output: 
•	There is still a great deal to discuss regarding how best to use ADA testing
•	While it is not practical or cost-efficient to test all patients, ADA testing can provide information in certain patient populations, including patients who are not responding to treatment with a biologic agent
    o	If the patient has no/low drug concentration, measure ADAs
        	If a high ADA titer is found, the drug is likely being cleared because of immunogenicity
        	The drug mechanism is not failing, but the specific drug is failing; can switch from 1 anti-TNF agent to another
    o	If the patient’s drug concentration is at a good level, then consider that the target is blocked (drug mechanism is failing)
        	Switch to a drug with a different mechanism of action
•	If the patient is responding well, but a low drug concentration is present, there are 2 explanations
    o	The patient is doing well and not taking his or her drugs 
    o	The patient is doing well despite making ADAs and clearing the drug

ANOTHER EDGE CASE 2:

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Level 2&gt;&gt; Potential Predictors of Response to Anti-TNF Treatment<sup>[11]</sup></strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Several factors help predict response to anti-TNF therapy</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Concomitant use of MTX</p>

<p>&#9642;	Patients on monotherapy, without using combination therapy with MTX, are at increased risk of developing neutralizing antibodies</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Patients with a higher body mass index require more bioavailability of the drug; they may need more drug to have an effect</p>

<p>&#9642;	May never develop ADAs</p>

<p>&#9642;	Probably more relevant for drug levels</p>

<p><tt>o	</tt>Patients with impaired renal function are more likely to retain the drug, leading to higher drug levels</p>
